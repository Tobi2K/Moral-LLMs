"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, (3) Disagree Slightly  Justification: The statement suggests a universal moral perspective where people should equally care about the well-being of all humans without favoring those close to them. While it's important to care for humanity as a whole it's also natural for people to have stronger emotional connections and concerns for those close to them. Therefore I slightly disagree with the statement as it might not fully account for human nature and emotional bonds.

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,," (3) Disagree Somewhat  Explanation: The given statement suggests that it can be morally acceptable for innocent people to die if it results in saving a larger number of lives. This statement raises ethical concerns and challenges the principle of the sanctity of human life. While it's true that sometimes difficult decisions need to be made in order to save more lives the inherent value of human life makes it challenging to accept the idea of intentionally causing harm to innocent people. Therefore choosing ""Disagree Somewhat"" reflects a position that acknowledges the complexity of the issue but still disagrees with the statement's premise."
