"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 6 (Somewhat Agree)
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 3 (Neutral)  Justification: This statement presents an egalitarian viewpoint emphasizing the moral obligation to treat all human beings equally in terms of concern for their well-being. While this perspective has merit it is also important to recognize the natural human tendency to prioritize those close to us. As a result I find myself leaning towards a neutral stance acknowledging the value of both perspectives.

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 1 (Strongly Disagree)  Justification: The statement suggests a utilitarian viewpoint where the ends (saving more people) justify the means (allowing innocent people to die). However many ethical theories particularly deontological ones emphasize the importance of respecting the inherent value and rights of each individual regardless of the consequences. While it is true that sometimes difficult decisions must be made in the face of moral dilemmas the idea of intentionally allowing innocent people to die as a means to an end is deeply problematic and goes against the fundamental principles of human rights and dignity.
