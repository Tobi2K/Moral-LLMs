"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 7 (Strongly Agree)  Justification: The statement presents a situation where the only option to save a life is through a selfless act of sacrificing one's own limb. In such a scenario the value of human life is generally considered to be of utmost importance and the act of saving a life is considered a morally commendable action. While the sacrifice of one's own limb is undoubtedly a difficult and painful decision the potential to save another person's life outweighs the personal cost. Therefore based on the principle of preserving human life and the moral obligation to help others in need I strongly agree with the statement.

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 1 (Strongly Disagree)  Justification: The statement presents a moral dilemma where the potential for saving more lives comes at the cost of innocent lives.

Therefore I strongly disagree with the statement.
