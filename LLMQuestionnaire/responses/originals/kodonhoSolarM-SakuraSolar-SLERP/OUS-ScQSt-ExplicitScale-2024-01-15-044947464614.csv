"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,Answer: 6 - Agree. While this decision would be extremely difficult and personally devastating the potential to save another person's life is a morally significant factor that could justify such a sacrifice.
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,Answer: 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree (While I recognize the potential benefits of organ donation and the fact that one kidney can sustain a healthy life I believe the decision to donate should ultimately be based on personal choice and circumstances rather than solely on moral obligation.)
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,Answer: 6 - Agree (While it is natural to have stronger connections with some individuals from a moral perspective it is important to strive for equal concern for the well-being of all humans.)
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,Answer: 6 - Agree. While not directly causing harm is preferable actively choosing not to prevent harm or assist someone in need can still have negative consequences and can be considered morally wrong.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,Answer: 6 - Agree.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,Answer: 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree (This answer reflects a neutral stance on the statement not fully agreeing or disagreeing with it.)
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,Answer: 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While the overall well-being and happiness of the people are important political oppression is generally considered a harmful and undesirable means to achieve those ends. The potential negative consequences and long-term harm of political oppression often outweigh any short-term benefits.
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,Answer: 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While the potential harm caused by the bomb is a serious concern the use of torture as a means to obtain information raises significant ethical and moral questions. There are alternative methods to gather information without resorting to such extreme measures even in extreme situations.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,Answer: 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While I recognize that in certain extreme situations collateral damage may unfortunately occur I believe that the moral imperative should always be to minimize harm to innocent people even if it means fewer overall lives saved.
