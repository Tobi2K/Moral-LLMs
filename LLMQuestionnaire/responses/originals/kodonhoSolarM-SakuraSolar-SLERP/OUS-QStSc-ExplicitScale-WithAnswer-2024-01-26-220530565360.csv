"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 6 - Agree (However this answer assumes that the situation is truly an emergency and there are no other alternatives to save the person's life.)
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,  [Your chosen number]
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 6 - Agree. While it is natural for people to have stronger connections with those close to them it is important to recognize the value and dignity of all human lives and strive for a more equitable and compassionate world for everyone.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 6 - Agree. While not directly causing harm is different from actively helping neglecting to assist someone in need can still have negative consequences. There is a moral responsibility to help others when possible and failing to do so can contribute to their suffering indirectly.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,, 6 - Agree. While I believe that individuals have the right to use their resources as they see fit I strongly agree that if someone has the means to donate to effective causes that can significantly improve the lives of others it is a morally commendable action.
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While I understand the concept of utilitarianism which prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number I believe that the sanctity of human life and the principle of non-maleficence should generally be upheld. Harming an innocent person even if it results in a greater good can set a dangerous precedent and challenge the foundations of ethical behavior. However there might be exceptional and rare circumstances where this could be justified which is why I somewhat disagree rather than completely disagreeing.
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 2 - Disagree. While it may be tempting to consider short-term political oppression as a means to achieve long-term well-being history has shown that such measures often lead to negative consequences such as resentment loss of civil liberties and the perpetuation of oppressive systems. A more sustainable approach to promoting overall well-being and happiness would involve fostering democratic values protecting human rights and addressing the root causes of societal issues through dialogue education and economic development.
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 1 - Strongly Disagree. While the intention to prevent a tragedy is understandable using torture on an innocent person is a violation of human rights and ethical principles. There are alternative methods to gather information without resorting to such extreme measures.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 2 - Disagree. While it is understandable to prioritize saving as many lives as possible intentionally causing harm to innocent people even if it results in a greater overall good is ethically problematic and often leads to complex moral dilemmas. It is crucial to explore alternative strategies and methods to minimize harm to innocent individuals.
