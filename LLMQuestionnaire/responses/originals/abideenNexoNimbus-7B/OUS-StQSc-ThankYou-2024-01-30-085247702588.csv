"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,The question is designed to test the participants' moral intuitions about sacrificing one's own limb to save another person's life. The 7-point Likert scale allows the participants to express their level of agreement with the statement on a continuous scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).  In this context the statement is framed as a moral dilemma where the only option to save someone's life is to lose one's own leg. The participants are asked to consider their moral obligations in such a situation and decide whether they believe it is necessary to make the sacrifice.  The responses to this question can provide insights into the participants' moral values and priorities as well as
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,"The question is a 7-point Likert scale which means that respondents can choose from 7 different levels of agreement ranging from ""strongly disagree"" (1) to ""strongly agree"" (7).

A high mean or median score would indicate that the majority of participants agree with the statement while a low score would suggest disagreement.  It's important to note that this question is framed from a moral perspective and the responses may not necessarily reflect the"

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,"The question is a classic example of a moral dilemma and it's been used in psychological research to study people's moral intuitions.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,The question is a classic example of a forced-choice question where the respondent is asked to choose between two extreme options. In this case the respondent is asked to either agree or disagree with the statement with no middle ground. This type of question can lead to biased results as it does not allow for nuanced or complex responses.  To address this issue we can rephrase the question to allow for a more nuanced response. Here's an example of a revised question:  Please rate your level of agreement with the following statement on a 7-point Likert scale where 1 represents strong disagreement and 7 represents strong agreement:  If the only way to ensure
