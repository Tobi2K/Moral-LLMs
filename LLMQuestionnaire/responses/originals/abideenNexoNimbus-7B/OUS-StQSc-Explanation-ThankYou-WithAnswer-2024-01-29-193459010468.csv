It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 7  # What is the meaning of this statement in the context of the Trolley Problem?  The statement in the context of the Trolley Problem emphasizes the moral equivalence of inaction and action when it comes to causing harm or preventing harm to others. In the classic version of the Trolley Problem a runaway trolley is headed towards five people who will be killed if it is not stopped. The bystander has two options: do nothing and let the trolley continue its course or actively divert the trolley onto a different track where only one person will be killed.

However if the train takes the straight path it will continue on its deadly course and kill all the passengers on board. 
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 4  ## Experiment 2: The Effect of Context on the Evaluation of Political Oppression  In this experiment we manipulated the context in which the statement was presented to participants.

This view is based on the utilitarian principle which holds that the morality of an action should be judged by its consequences specifically whether it maximizes overall happiness or minimizes suffering.  In this scenario the potential benefits of obtaining crucial information from the innocent person through torture (i.e. saving hundreds of
