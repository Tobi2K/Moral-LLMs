"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,," 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ```  The code above will output a 7-point-likert scale question about the moral obligation to donate a kidney. The respondent will be asked to choose a number from 1 to 7 where 1 represents strong disagreement and 7 represents strong agreement with the statement.  ## Answer (0)  Here's a simple way to create a 7-point Likert scale question in Python using the `input()` function:  ```python print(""Statement: From a moral point of view we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kid"
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ```  The code above will output a list of 7 integers each representing the response of a participant to the question.  To analyze the data you can calculate the mean of the responses. The mean will give you an idea of how much the participants agree with the statement on average.  Here's an example of how you can calculate the mean using Python:  ```python import numpy as np  # Assuming you have a list of responses from participants responses = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7]  # Calculate the mean
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 7  The survey has finished. Thank you for your participation.  #### 7.1.2.2 Explanation  In this example the researcher is interested in understanding the participants' agreement with a specific statement. The statement is about the moral equivalence between not helping someone and actively harming them. The participants are asked to respond using a 7-point Likert scale where 1 represents strong disagreement and 7 represents strong agreement. The researcher does not ask for any explanation or elaboration on the participants' responses.  #### 7.1.3 Open-Ended Questions  Open-ended questions allow participants to provide their own responses without being limited to a
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,," 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  ### Conceptualization of Moral Wrongness  To understand the conceptualization of moral wrongness in the context of this study we asked participants to provide a definition of moral wrongness.  Question: Please provide a definition of what you consider to be a ""moral wrong.""  ### Personal Moral Beliefs  To assess participants' personal moral beliefs we asked them to rate the importance of various moral values in their own lives.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ```  The output will be a list of 7 integers each representing the number of times a participant chose that option.  To calculate the average you can sum all the integers and divide by the total number of participants.  ```python # Assuming 'data' is the list of integers from the survey total = sum(data) average = total / len(data) print(average) ```  This will give you the average response on the 7-point Likert scale for the given statement.  Remember to handle edge cases where the list is empty
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  ## 1.

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ```  The code above will display the statement and ask the user to respond with a number from 1 to 7 representing their level of agreement with the statement.  To analyze the responses you can use a Python library like `pandas` to read the data from a CSV file and calculate the mean of the responses. Here's an example:  ```python import pandas as pd  # Read the responses from a CSV file data = pd.read_csv('responses.csv')  # Calculate the mean of the responses mean_response = data['Answer'].mean
