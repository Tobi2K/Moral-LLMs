"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,Edit: I'm sorry I didn't realize this was a survey question. I'm not looking for a specific answer but rather a general understanding of how people feel about this statement. User 1: I'd say 5 - Somewhat Agree.

So while the moral argument is compelling it's also important to consider the physical consequences for the donor.

It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.

It's interesting to see that most people agree with this statement. It highlights the importance of empathy and compassion in our society.  However it's also important to consider the complexity of real-life situations where helping someone might not always be possible or safe.

In a perfect world we wouldn't have to make such difficult decisions but we live in a world where sometimes we have to choose the lesser of two evils.  However I'm not fully comfortable with the idea of intentionally harming an innocent person even if it's for the greater good. It's a very slip"

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,I'm a 22 year old male from the United States.
