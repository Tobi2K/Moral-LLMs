"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,3 - ### #10 by I would say that it depends on the situation and the person. While in some cases sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life might be seen as a moral obligation in other situations the individual might have other responsibilities or dependents that they need to consider. It's not a one-size-fits-all answer.  However if we are strictly looking at the statement and assuming that the person has no other significant responsibilities or dependents then I would lean towards agreeing with the statement. In such a scenario saving a life especially in an emergency could be seen as a higher moral imperative.  So

It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,3 - ### #10 by I think it depends on the situation. In some cases not helping someone could be as bad as actively harming them but in other cases it might not be as significant.  However if we're talking about general moral principles then I would agree that failing to help someone when you have the ability to do so can be considered wrong especially if the person in need is suffering or in danger.  So I would choose option 5 - Somewhat Agree but with the understanding that there are nuances and exceptions to this statement. - ### #11 by I believe that not helping someone in need can be just as wrong as actively harming
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ```  The code above will output the number you choose as your response.  To analyze the data you can use a tool like Python's pandas library to create a DataFrame and perform various statistical analyses. Here's an example of how you can do that:  ```python import pandas as pd  # Assuming you have collected the responses in a list called'responses' data = {'Response': responses} df = pd.DataFrame(data)  # Calculate the frequency of each response frequency = df['Response'].value_counts()  # Print the frequency distribution
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,3 - ### #10 by I don't think it's possible to make a general statement about this as the specific circumstances would have to be taken into account.

In such cases it might be morally justifiable to cause harm to one individual
