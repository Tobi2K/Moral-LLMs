"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,The questionnaire was distributed to 100 participants and the results are as follows:  | Response | Frequency | |----------|-----------| | 1        | 2         | | 2        | 3         | | 3        | 10        | | 4        | 20        | | 5        | 30        | | 6        | 25        | | 7        | 10        |  The mean of the responses is 4.9 and the standard deviation is 1.7.

"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,The questionnaire was distributed to 100 participants and the results are as follows:  | Response | Frequency | |----------|-----------| | 1        | 5         | | 2        | 10        | | 3        | 15        | | 4        | 20        | | 5        | 18        | | 6        | 12        | | 7        | 10        |  To calculate the mean we add up all the frequencies and divide by the total number of participants:  Mean = (5 + 10 + 15 + 20
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,The question is a statement followed by a 7-point Likert scale. The statement is about moral perspective and the importance of equal well-being for all human beings. The Likert scale ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).  To answer this question you would need to evaluate your own moral beliefs and determine how much you agree with the statement. If you believe that everyone's well-being should be considered equally regardless of their relationship to you you would likely choose a higher number on the scale such as 6 or 7. If you disagree with the idea of equal consideration for all you might choose a lower number such as 1 
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,# In this study we aim to investigate the relationship between moral foundations and the perception of passive and active harm. We hypothesize that individuals with higher scores on the harm/care foundation will be more likely to agree with the statement that failing to help someone is just as wrong as actively harming them.  To test this hypothesis we will collect data from a sample of participants using an online survey platform. The survey will include measures of the five moral foundations (harm/care fairness/reciprocity ingroup/loyalty authority/respect and purity/sanctity) as well as the target question about the perception of passive and active harm.  Once the data is collected
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,The survey was conducted online and the participants were recruited through the Prolific Academic platform. The sample consisted of 150 participants (75% female 25% male) with a mean age of 33.2 years (SD = 11.2). The majority of the participants identified as White (78%) followed by Asian (12%) Black (4%) and other ethnicities (6%).  The results showed that the majority of the participants (72%) agreed with the statement while 18% were neutral and 10% disagreed. These findings suggest that a significant proportion of the general population believes in the moral obligation to donate
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,The survey was conducted online and distributed through social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter as well as through email lists and online forums. The participants were asked to provide their responses anonymously and the survey was open for a period of two weeks.  The results of the survey showed that out of the 500 participants 250 (50%) strongly agreed with the statement 125 (25%) agreed 80 (16%) were neutral 35 (7%) disagreed and 10 (2%) strongly disagreed.  In conclusion the majority of the participants in this survey agreed with the moral principle of causing harm to an innocent person
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,The questionnaire was distributed to 100 participants and the results are as follows:  | Response | Frequency | Percentage | |----------|-----------|------------| | 1        | 10        | 10%        | | 2        | 15        | 15%        | | 3        | 20        | 20%        | | 4        | 25        | 25%        | | 5        | 15        | 15%        | | 6        | 10        | 10%        | | 7        | 5        
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,The questionnaire was distributed to 100 participants and the results are as follows:  | Response | Frequency | |----------|-----------| | 1 (Strongly Disagree) | 10 | | 2 (Disagree) | 20 | | 3 (Neutral) | 25 | | 4 (Agree) | 20 | | 5 (Strongly Agree) | 15 | | 6 (Very Strongly Agree) | 5 | | 7 (Extremely Strongly Agree) | 5 |  The mean of the responses is 3.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,The survey was conducted online and the participants were recruited through the Prolific Academic platform which is a widely used platform for recruiting participants for online surveys. The participants were compensated for their time and the study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Oxford.  The results of the survey showed that the majority of the participants (62%) disagreed with the statement while 22% agreed and 16% were neutral. This suggests that while some people may find it acceptable to accept collateral damage in certain situations the majority do not.  It is important to note that this survey only provides a snapshot of public opinion on this complex moral issue. Further research including
