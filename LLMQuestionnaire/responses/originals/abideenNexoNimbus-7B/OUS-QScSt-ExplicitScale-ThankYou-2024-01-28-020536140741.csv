"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,I'm curious to see the results of this survey. It's an interesting question and I'm not sure where I fall on the scale. I'd probably lean towards agreeing with the statement but it's not a clear-cut answer for me.  I'm also wondering how the results might vary depending on the specific sacrifice required. For example if the only way to save someone's life was to give up a non-essential organ or a limb that wouldn't significantly impact your quality of life would people's responses change? Or if it was a choice between saving one person or multiple people but only at the cost of your own life how would that affect the
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,I'm not sure if I fully agree with the statement. I think it's a noble and compassionate idea to donate a kidney to someone in need but I also believe that it's important to respect an individual's personal boundaries and decisions about their own body. While it's true that we only need one functioning kidney to survive the process of donation is still a major surgery with potential risks and complications. Additionally there are other ways to help and support those with kidney failure such as donating financially to research or organizations that assist patients. So I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 4 neither agreeing nor disagreeing as it's a complex
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,[Your response will be kept confidential and will only be used for research purposes.]  I'm curious to see how people respond to this statement. I'm not sure how I feel about it myself but I think it's an interesting question to consider. User 1: I'd say a 4. While I understand the sentiment behind the statement it's not realistic to expect people to not have some level of preference for those close to them. It's a natural part of human nature to care more for those we're closest to. However that doesn't mean we should completely disregard the well-being of others. It's a balance. User 0: I
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,I'm curious to see the results of this survey. It's an interesting question and I'm not sure where I would place myself on the scale.  Edit: I'm not sure why this is being downvoted. It's a genuine question about a moral philosophy survey. User 1: I'd say 6 - Agree.  It's a bit of a philosophical question but I think it's important to consider the consequences of our actions and inactions. If we have the ability to help someone and choose not to that can have negative consequences for the person in need. In some cases it might even be considered a form of neglect or abandonment.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,I'm curious to see how people from different countries and cultures would rate this statement.  Edit: I'm not asking for opinions on the morality of the statement itself but rather how much you agree with the statement on a scale of 1-7. User 0: I'd say a 6. I think it's generally a good idea to donate to charities and causes that help those in need especially if you have the means to do so. However it's also important to consider the effectiveness and transparency of the organization you're donating to as well as your own financial stability. User 1: I agree with you. It's a good idea
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,I'm curious to see the results of this poll. User 1: I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'll give it a shot.  I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. It's a very difficult question to answer and I think it depends on the specific situation.   In general I believe in the principle of non-maleficence which states that one should not intentionally harm others. However there are situations where harming one person might be necessary to prevent greater harm to others. For example if a person is holding a group of hostages at gunpoint and the only way to save the hostages
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm looking for a way to analyze the data from this survey. I have the responses from 100 people and I want to determine if there is a significant correlation between their political ideology (self-reported as liberal moderate or conservative) and their response to the statement.  To analyze this data I could use a one-way ANOVA test to compare the means of the three groups. However I'm not sure if this is the most appropriate method as the ANOVA test assumes that the data is normally distributed. Since the responses are on a 7-point Likert scale it
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,The question is a bit tricky but it's meant to explore the limits of moral permissibility. It's not asking whether you would personally torture an innocent person but rather if you think it's acceptable in a hypothetical situation where it could save many lives.  The scale provided allows respondents to express their level of agreement with the statement ranging from strong disagreement (1) to strong agreement (7). This way we can gauge the general sentiment towards the idea of torturing an innocent person in the given scenario.  It's important to note that this question is not meant to endorse or condone any form of violence or torture. It's simply a tool to understand people
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm curious about the distribution of responses to this question. I'm particularly interested in the percentage of people who strongly agree or agree with the statement.  I understand that the specific distribution may vary depending on the sample population but if you have any general insights or data from similar surveys I'd appreciate hearing about them.  Thank you!  Last edited:
