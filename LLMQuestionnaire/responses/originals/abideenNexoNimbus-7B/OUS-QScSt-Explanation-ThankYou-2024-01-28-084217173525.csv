The statement suggests that in some cases it might be morally acceptable for innocent people to die as a result of collateral damage as long as more lives are saved overall.  The question was designed to elicit a response on a 7-point Likert scale which ranges from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). This scale allows researchers to measure the degree
