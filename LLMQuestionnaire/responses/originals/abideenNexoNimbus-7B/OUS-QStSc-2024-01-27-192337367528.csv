Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. No Opinion 7. Not Applicable  I'm not sure if I agree with the statement.

This suggests that the overall well-being and happiness of the people is more important than the principles of freedom and democracy.  In this context I would slightly disagree with the statement. While it's possible that a temporary use of political oppression

However the only way to defuse the bomb is to trigger a smaller explosion that unint
