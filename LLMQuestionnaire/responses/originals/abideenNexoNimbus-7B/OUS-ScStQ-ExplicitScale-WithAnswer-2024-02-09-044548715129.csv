"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 6 - Agree  Explanation: The statement suggests that in an extreme situation where the only way to save another person's life is by sacrificing one's own leg it is morally obligatory to do so. This view aligns with the concept of altruism and the moral principle of duty or deontology which emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's moral obligations regardless of personal consequences.

"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 6 - Agree  I agree with the statement because from a moral perspective we should treat everyone with equal respect and concern regardless of our personal relationships with them.

The question is asking about a moral ideal not about what people actually do in real life. In an ideal world we should all care about the well-being of every human being equally without favoring those who are close to us. This is because all human beings have inherent value and deserve to be treated with dignity and compassion.  However
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 7 - Strongly Agree  I believe that failing to help someone when you have the ability to do so can have just as negative consequences as actively harming them. Both actions can lead to suffering and pain for the person in need. It is our moral responsibility to assist others when we can and not doing so can be just as wrong as causing harm.  In situations where someone is in immediate danger or requires urgent assistance not helping can be considered as a passive form of harm. It may not be as direct as physically hurting someone but it can still result in negative outcomes for the person in need. For example if you witness a car accident and choose not to call for help or provide aid you are

However in a situation where the lives of hundreds of innocent people are at stake it is difficult to completely rule out the possibility of using torture as a last resort to obtain critical information. It is a morally complex issue that requires deep reflection and careful consideration.  [END]
