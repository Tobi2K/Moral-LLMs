"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,4 - ### #176833  I'm a 22 year old female and I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years.

It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,I chose 6 - Agree User 1: I chose 7 - Strongly Agree User 0: I chose 6 - Agree  It's interesting to see that we both strongly agree with the statement but we didn't choose the same level of agreement.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,"I'm a bot and this action was performed automatically. User: 4 ```  #### 4  The question is asking about the moral acceptability of causing harm to an innocent person if it is necessary to save several others.

In this scenario a runaway trolley is headed towards a group of five people who will be killed if it continues on its current path. You are standing near a lever that if pulled will divert the trolley onto a different track where it will"
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,"3  I'm not sure if I would agree with the statement in general but in certain extreme situations it might be necessary to temporarily use political oppression to restore order and protect the well-being of the people. However it's crucial to ensure that this measure is only a temporary solution and that the government transitions back to a democratic system as soon as possible.  In the end I chose option 3 ""Somewhat Disagree"" because while I understand the potential necessity of political oppression in extreme circumstances I still have reservations about it as a long-term solution. It's essential to prioritize the protection of individual rights and freedoms even if it means taking temporary less"

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,"I chose 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree  I understand that this is a complex and sensitive issue and there may be situations where difficult decisions have to be made in order to save the greatest number of lives. However I personally struggle with the idea of intentionally causing harm to innocent people even if it is for the greater good. It's a tough balance to strike and I don't feel strongly one way or the other about it.  In a different context if you were asked to rate your agreement with the statement ""Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall"" on a scale from 1 to 7"
