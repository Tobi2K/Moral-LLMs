"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,I'm curious to see the distribution of responses to this question.

It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,"In this survey the statement ""It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it bystander effect it is to actively harm them yourself"" is being evaluated.

The question asks respondents to rate their agreement with the statement on a scale from 1 to 7 with 1 being ""Strongly Disagree"" and 7 being ""Strongly Agree.""  This question aims to gauge people's moral beliefs and attitudes towards responsibility and empathy. It encourages reflection on the idea that not intervening in a situation where help is needed can be just as morally"

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,"I'm curious to see the distribution of responses to this question.  Edit: I'm not looking for a debate on the morality of political oppression but rather an understanding of how people feel about the statement itself. User 1: I'd say 3 - Somewhat Disagree.

It's also important to consider that the well-being and happiness of the people is subjective and can be manipulated by those in power. "
