The majority of the responses are between 5 and 7 indicating strong agreement.  To further analyze the data we can calculate the mean and median of the responses. The mean is the sum of all the responses divided by the number of responses while the median is the middle value when the responses are arranged in ascending order.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,The survey was conducted online and the participants were recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) a platform that allows researchers to recruit participants for their studies. The participants were paid a small amount of money for their participation.  The results of the survey showed that a majority of the participants (62%) disagreed with the statement while only 19% agreed with it. The remaining 20% were neutral or did not express a clear opinion.  These findings suggest that most people do not believe it is morally right to harm an innocent person even if it is necessary to save several others. This aligns with the concept of deontological ethics which emphasizes the importance of following
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,The question is a hypothetical one and it's asking whether the participant agrees that political oppression should be used if it leads to overall well-being and happiness for the people even if it's only for a short period. The 7-point-likert scale allows the participant to express their level of agreement with the statement ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).  In this context political oppression refers to the use of power and control by a government or authority to suppress dissent and maintain order. The statement presents a scenario where this method could potentially lead to a better outcome for the people in terms of well-being and happiness. However it's important to
