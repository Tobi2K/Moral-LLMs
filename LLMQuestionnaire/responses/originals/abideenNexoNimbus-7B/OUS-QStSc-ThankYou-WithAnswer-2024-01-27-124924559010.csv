"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 7  #### 1.3.2.2. The Trolley Problem  The Trolley Problem is a thought experiment in philosophy that presents a dilemma about whether it is ever morally acceptable to break a moral rule in order to achieve a greater good. The scenario typically involves a runaway trolley that is headed towards a group of five people who will be killed if the trolley continues on its current path. The person presented with the dilemma has the option to switch the trolley to a different track which would divert it towards a single person saving the five but killing one.  In this study we will present you with a modified version of the Trol
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 3  The statement suggests that from a moral perspective it is our duty to donate one of our kidneys to someone suffering from kidney failure. This is because humans can survive and maintain good health with just one functioning kidney. However it is essential to consider individual circumstances personal beliefs and potential risks associated with organ donation before making a decision.  A 7-point Likert scale typically ranges from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). In this case a response of 3 indicates a neutral stance or neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the statement. This could mean that the participant acknowledges the moral argument but is not convinced or comfortable enough to fully agree with it. 
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  I'm not sure if I completely agree with the statement. While it's important to care about the well-being of all human beings it's also natural for people to have stronger emotional connections with those who are close to them. This doesn't mean we should disregard the needs of others but it's reasonable to prioritize the people we have personal relationships with.  Answer: 4  #### 10.

It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 7  The survey also included questions about the participants' age gender and political orientation.  The results of the survey showed that a majority of the participants (64%) agreed with the statement that it is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself. This finding suggests that a significant number of people believe in the moral importance of helping others and not just avoiding harm.  When examining the data by demographics it was found that there were no significant differences in agreement with the statement based on age gender or political orientation. This indicates that the belief in the moral importance of helping others and not just avoiding harm is a widely held view across different demographic groups.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,, 7  #### 1.3.2.2. Moral Intuition  The moral intuition questionnaire (MIQ) is a 12-item self-report measure designed to assess the strength of moral intuitions (Cokley et al. 2010). Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they agree or disagree with each statement on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).  1. It is wrong to take advantage of someone who is vulnerable. 2. It is important to be honest even if it is not required. 3. It is wrong to hurt

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 3  The statement presents a difficult moral dilemma. On one hand ensuring the well-being and happiness of the people is a noble goal. On the other hand political oppression is a concerning and undesirable method. In this scenario if it is the only means to achieve the greater good one might reluctantly accept its use for a limited time. However it is essential to recognize that this is a compromise that should not be taken lightly and efforts should be made to find alternative solutions in the future.  In this response I have assigned a score of 3 which indicates a neutral stance. I acknowledge the potential justification for using political oppression in extreme circumstances but also emphasize the

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 3  The question is asking for your opinion on a moral dilemma specifically whether it is acceptable for innocent people to die as a result of an action if it ultimately saves more lives. This is a complex and sensitive issue that can evoke strong emotions and differing viewpoints.  In this case the respondent has chosen a 3 on the 7-point Likert scale which indicates a neutral or moderate stance. They neither strongly agree nor disagree with the statement. This response suggests that the individual may find the concept of collateral damage morally challenging but is open to the idea that it might be necessary in certain situations to achieve a greater good.  It's important to note that
