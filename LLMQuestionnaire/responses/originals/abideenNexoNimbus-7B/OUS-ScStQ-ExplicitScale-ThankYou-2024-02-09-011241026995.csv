It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm looking for a way to analyze the data from this survey.

I have the data in a CSV file with columns for the respondent's ID gender age and their response to the statement (1-7).  Any guidance or suggestions on how to proceed with the analysis would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!  Last edited:

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm curious about the reasoning behind the scale.
