"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 6  In this scenario the individual is faced with a life-or-death situation where the only way to save another person's life is by sacrificing their own leg.

In the case of kidney donation the
