"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 7  ## 1. Introduction  The trolley problem is a classic thought experiment in moral philosophy that has been used to explore the nature of moral decision-making and the principles that guide our actions.
