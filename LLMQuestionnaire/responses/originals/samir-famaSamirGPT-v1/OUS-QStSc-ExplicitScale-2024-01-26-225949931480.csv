"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree  I think it depends on the context and the person's values. For some the value of saving a life may outweigh the loss of a leg. For others the loss of a leg may be too great a sacrifice. It's a difficult decision to make and can't be generalized for everyone.  ## 1.

"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,I would rate this a 5 - Somewhat Agree. While I understand the logic behind the statement I also believe that there are other factors to consider such as the potential risks and complications of donating a kidney as well as the importance of informed consent. Additionally there may be other ways to help those in need of a kidney transplant such as donating money or time to support research and awareness.  ## 1.

It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,5 - Somewhat Agree  I think that failing to help someone can be wrong in certain situations but it's not always as morally wrong as actively harming them. The degree of wrongness depends on the context and the consequences of not helping.  For example if you see someone drowning and you have the ability to save them but choose not to that's clearly wrong. However if you're not in a position to help and there are other people around who can it might not be as morally wrong.  In general I believe that we have a responsibility to help others when we can but it's not always as black and white as the statement suggests.  
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,I would rate this a 6 - Agree.  I think it's important to consider the needs of others and to help those who are less fortunate. If you have the means to donate money to a cause that will make a significant impact on someone's life it's a morally responsible thing to do.  However it's also important to take care of your own needs and financial stability. If you're not in a position to donate without jeopardizing your own well-being it's not necessarily morally wrong to keep the money for yourself.  In summary while I agree that it's morally wrong to keep money that you don't need
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,I'd say 3 - Somewhat Disagree  I think it's a very difficult question to answer. I'm not sure if I'd agree with the statement in all cases. It depends on the specific situation and the consequences of the harm.  For example if harming one person is the only way to save the lives of many others it might be morally justifiable. However if there are other less harmful options available then it might not be.  In general I believe in minimizing harm and finding non-violent solutions whenever possible. User 1: I'd say 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree  I think it'
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,I would rate this a 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While I understand the idea that in some extreme situations political oppression may be necessary to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people I believe that there are always other less drastic measures that can be taken first. Additionally the use of political oppression can often lead to long-term negative consequences and further harm to the people.  ## 1. The influence of social media on politics  The influence of social media on politics is undeniable. It has transformed the way people consume and engage with political information as well as how politicians and political parties communicate with their constituents.  Social media platforms like Facebook Twitter
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,I would give this a 3 - Somewhat Disagree.  I think it's important to consider the rarity of such a situation and the likelihood that there are other means of obtaining the information. However if it were truly the only option I would lean towards agreeing that it would be necessary to prevent a large-scale tragedy.  It's also crucial to note that this is a hypothetical scenario and in reality the consequences of such actions would be far-reaching and difficult to predict.  In summary while I somewhat disagree with the statement I recognize the extreme nature of the situation and the potential justification for such a drastic measure.  ## 2.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,I'm a 4.

I think it's a very difficult question to answer. It's a question of weighing the value of one life against the value of many lives. It's a question of whether the ends justify the means.  I think it's important to consider the context. If the alternative is to let a terrorist attack kill hundreds or thousands of people then it might be morally necessary to take out the
