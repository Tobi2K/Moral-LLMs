I believe that it is natural and necessary for people to prioritize the well-being of those who are especially close to them whether physically or emotionally. This is because we have limited resources and time and it is only reasonable to focus on the people we care about the
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 7  I strongly agree with the statement. It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.  The statement highlights the importance of empathy and responsibility towards others.

In many situations failing to help someone can lead to negative consequences such as suffering pain or even death. This is especially true in cases of emergency or when someone is in immediate danger.  Moreover the statement also implies that we have a moral obligation to help others. This obligation is not limited to our family friends or people in our community but extends to

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 1  I do not agree with the statement.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  ## General Comments  The results of this survey are not statistically significant but they do provide some interesting insights.  The majority of respondents (57%) disagreed with the statement while 29% agreed and 14% were neutral.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 1  I strongly disagree with the statement.  The use of torture is never justified regardless of the potential consequences. Torture is a violation of human rights and fundamental principles of justice. It is also ineffective in obtaining accurate information as people under torture often provide false information to end the pain.  Instead of resorting to torture we should focus on developing effective intelligence gathering techniques that respect human dignity and uphold the rule of law.  In the case of a potential bombing it is crucial to prioritize the protection of human rights and the rule of law. This includes ensuring that all investigations are conducted in a manner that is transparent accountable and respectful of human dignity.
