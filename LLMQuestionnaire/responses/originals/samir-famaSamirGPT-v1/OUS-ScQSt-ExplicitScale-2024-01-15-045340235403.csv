It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,I'm not sure if I can answer this question. I'm not a philosopher or an expert in ethics. However I can share my personal thoughts on the matter.  I would say that I somewhat disagree with the statement.

In such cases it is crucial to have a system of checks and balances in place to ensure that the use of torture is a last resort and that it is not used
