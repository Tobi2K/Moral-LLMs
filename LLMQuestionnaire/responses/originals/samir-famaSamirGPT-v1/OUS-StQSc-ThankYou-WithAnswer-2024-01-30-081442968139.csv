This is not necessarily a bad thing as it is a natural part of our social and emotional development. But it is crucial to be aware of this bias and make a conscious effort to extend our compassion and care to all people regardless of their proximity to us.

I believe that wealth and resources should be distributed in a way that benefits the most people possible. When we have more than we need it is our responsibility to use that excess to help those who are less fortunate.

By donating to these causes we can make a significant impact on the lives of others.  Furthermore giving to those

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 1  I strongly disagree with the statement.

While I understand the argument that political oppression could be a means to achieve short-term benefits I believe that the long-term costs and the damage to the social fabric outweigh any potential gains. Additionally there are other more democratic and humane ways
