"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 5  I believe that from a moral point of view it is commendable to donate a kidney to someone in need. However I also recognize that it is a personal decision and not everyone may feel the same obligation.  [Note: This survey is not intended to be a scientific study and the results do not claim to represent a specific population. It is simply a means to gather opinions on the topic.] User 1: I'm not sure I'd agree with the statement. While it's true that you only need one kidney to be healthy it's also a major surgery with risks and potential complications. It's not a decision to be taken lightly.  
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,," 6 - Agree  I agree with the statement from a moral perspective. However it is important to note that while we should strive to care for all human beings equally it is natural and unavoidable for us to have stronger emotional connections with some people than others. These connections can lead to us prioritizing the well-being of those close to us. The key is to be aware of this bias and make an effort to balance our care and concern for all human beings.  Additionally it is worth considering that the concept of ""equally"" can be challenging to apply in practice. For example we may have more resources to help those close to us or we may be more aware of their"
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,," 7  I strongly agree with the statement. Failing to help someone in need can have just as detrimental an effect on their well-being as actively harming them. Both actions demonstrate a lack of empathy and compassion and can lead to negative consequences for the person in need.  It is important to recognize that we all have a responsibility to help others when we can and not doing so can be just as harmful as causing harm directly. This is why the concept of ""bystander apathy"" is so problematic - when people witness someone in need and choose to do nothing they are essentially contributing to the problem.  In conclusion I believe that the statement is an accurate reflection of the"

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 3  I don't think it's a clear-cut situation. While the intention to help others is noble the act of harming an innocent person is still morally wrong. It's a difficult balance to strike and I'm not sure there's a definitive answer. User 1: I agree with your answer. It's a very difficult question to answer. I think it depends on the specific situation and the potential consequences of each action. In some cases it may be the lesser of two evils but in others it could lead to even more harm. It's a very nuanced issue. User 0: Yes it's a very nuanced
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree  I believe that the use of political oppression even for a short limited period can have long-lasting negative consequences on the overall well-being and happiness of the people. While it may be argued that such measures are necessary to achieve a greater good the potential harm to individual rights and freedoms should not be underestimated.  In addition the effectiveness of political oppression in achieving the desired outcomes is not guaranteed. History has shown that oppressive regimes often fail to deliver on their promises and can even lead to more instability and conflict.  Therefore while I understand the rationale behind the statement I am somewhat inclined to disagree with the
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree  I believe that the ends do not justify the means in this case. While the intention of preventing a bomb from going off and saving lives is noble the use of torture on an innocent person is a violation of human rights and sets a dangerous precedent. There are other methods that can be used to gather information such as psychological techniques or non-coercive interrogation methods.  Additionally there is a risk of false information being obtained through torture which could lead to further harm or injustice. It is important to uphold the principles of justice and human dignity even in the face of extreme circumstances.  In conclusion while the goal of preventing a bombing
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree  I believe that while it is understandable that in some situations the greater good may require the loss of innocent lives it is still a difficult and morally complex decision. I would rather find alternative ways to minimize collateral damage and protect as many lives as possible.  Additionally it is important to consider the long-term consequences of such actions and the potential for creating more harm than good. The loss of innocent lives can have a significant impact on communities and individuals leading to trauma resentment and further conflict.  In conclusion while I understand the concept of collateral damage in certain circumstances I still somewhat disagree with the statement that it is morally necessary.
