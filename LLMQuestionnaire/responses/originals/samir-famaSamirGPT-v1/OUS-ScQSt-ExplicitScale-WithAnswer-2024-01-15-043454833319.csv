"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,," 6 - Agree  I believe that from a moral perspective we should strive to be as impartial as possible and care for the well-being of all human beings equally. However it is also natural for people to have stronger emotional connections to those who are close to them and this should not be seen as a moral failing.

Answer:
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree  I believe that the morality of such a situation is complex and context-dependent. While it may be tempting to say that harming one innocent person to save many others is morally right it is important to consider the potential consequences of such an action. For example if the harm caused to the one person sets a dangerous precedent or leads to further harm then the initial action may not be morally justifiable. Additionally the principle of proportionality should be taken into account as causing significant harm to one person may not be justified if the potential benefits to the others are relatively minor. Ultimately the decision to harm an innocent person in such a situation should be made
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree  Explanation: While it is understandable that some level of political oppression may be necessary in certain situations to maintain order and protect the well-being of the people it is not a desirable long-term solution. The use of political oppression can lead to a host of negative consequences such as the erosion of civil liberties the suppression of dissenting voices and the potential for abuse of power. Therefore while political oppression may be a necessary evil in some cases it should not be used as a means to ensure overall well-being and happiness in the long run.  ## 2.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree  I believe that the ends do not justify the means in this case. While the intention is to save lives the act of torturing an innocent person is a violation of their human rights and could potentially lead to further injustices. It is important to consider alternative methods of obtaining information that do not involve the use of torture.  However I recognize that this is a complex and emotionally charged issue and there may be situations where the decision to use torture is made in the heat of the moment. In such cases it is crucial to have a system of checks and balances in place to ensure that the use of torture is a last resort and that it is not used as a routine
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 4  I think it's a very difficult question to answer. It depends on the situation and the number of people involved. In some cases it may be necessary to accept collateral damage in order to save a greater number of lives. However it's not a decision that should be taken lightly and the consequences should be carefully considered.  So I would say that I neither agree nor disagree with the statement.  ## 2.
