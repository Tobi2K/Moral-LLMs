"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 7  I agree with the statement. In an emergency situation where the only way to save another person's life is to sacrifice one's own leg I believe that one is morally required to make this sacrifice. The well-being and survival of another human being takes precedence over one's own physical well-being in such extreme circumstances.  The principle of self-sacrifice for the greater good is deeply rooted in many moral and ethical systems. It is a demonstration of altruism and compassion which are considered virtues in most societies.  Moreover the act of saving a life can have a profound impact on the rescued individual their family and the community.
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 7  #### 1.1.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 7  I completely agree with the statement. From a moral perspective we should treat all human beings equally and not favor the well-being of those who are close to us. This is the foundation of universal human rights and the concept of a just society.  However it is important to note that while we should strive to be impartial and fair human nature often leads us to prioritize the well-being of those closest to us. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it is a natural part of our social and emotional development. But it is crucial to be aware of this bias and make a conscious effort to extend our compassion and care to all people regardless of their proximity to us.  
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 7  #### 1.1.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,, 7  I completely agree with the statement. It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn't really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.  I understand that everyone has different financial situations and needs but if someone has the means to donate and make a positive impact on others' lives it is a moral responsibility to do so.  There are countless organizations and charities that work tirelessly to help those in need whether it be providing food shelter education or medical care. By donating to these causes we can help alleviate suffering and improve the quality of life for many people.  In addition
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 6  I believe that in some extreme cases it may be morally right to harm an innocent person if it is the only way to save several other innocent people. However this is a very difficult decision to make and should not be taken lightly. It is important to consider all other options and to ensure that the harm caused is truly necessary and proportional to the potential good.  In general I would lean towards a more utilitarian approach where the overall well-being of the greatest number of people is taken into account. But I also recognize the importance of individual rights and the potential for unintended consequences.  Therefore I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 6 indicating that
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,," 3  Comment: I believe that political oppression should only be used as a last resort and it should be limited in time and scope. However I am not fully convinced that it is the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people.  [Moderator's note: In this survey a 7-point Likert scale was used where 1 represents ""Strongly Disagree"" and 7 represents ""Strongly Agree.""]"
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 1 (Strongly Disagree)  I am a computer programmer and not a philosopher but I believe that the ends do not justify the means. Torturing an innocent person is a violation of their human rights and it sets a dangerous precedent that could be used to justify further abuses. Additionally there is no guarantee that the information obtained through torture would be accurate or reliable.  In the case of a bomb threat it is important to gather information through legal and ethical means such as surveillance witness interviews and analysis of available evidence. While it may be tempting to resort to extreme measures in the face of a potential disaster it is crucial to uphold the principles of justice and
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 1 (Strongly Disagree)  I believe that the value of human life is inestimable and that the loss of any innocent life is a tragedy. While it may be true that in some situations taking the life of an innocent person may be necessary to save a greater number of lives this does not make it morally acceptable. The principle of double effect which is often used to justify such actions is problematic because it allows for the intentional harm of one person for the benefit of others. This is a slippery slope that can lead to a devaluation of human life and a disregard for the inherent dignity of every individual.  In addition the concept of coll
