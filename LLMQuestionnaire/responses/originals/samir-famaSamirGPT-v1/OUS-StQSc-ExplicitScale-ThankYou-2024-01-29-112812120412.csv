"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. I think it depends on the context and the person's values. For some people the value of saving a life might be so high that they would be morally required to make the sacrifice. For others the value of their own life and limb might be more important and they might not feel morally obligated to make the sacrifice. It's a difficult question to answer without more information about the specific situation and the individual's beliefs.  I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  ## 2.  Statement: It is morally wrong to lie even if the lie
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,I'm a 6.  I think the statement is a bit simplistic but the underlying idea is sound. We do only need one kidney to live a healthy life and there are many people who need a kidney transplant. However it's not as simple as just giving away a kidney. There are risks involved in the surgery and you'd be giving up a part of your body that you can't get back.  That being said if you're in a situation where you can safely donate a kidney to someone in need it's a very generous and selfless act that can save a life. User 1: I'm a 6
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,I'm a bit confused by the question. I think it's important to care for the well-being of all human beings but I also think it's natural and unavoidable to care more for those who are close to us. I would say I somewhat agree with the statement but I also think it's important to acknowledge the limitations of human nature.  So I would give it a 5.  ## 5  #### in total  static1.squarespace.com  ## Grading Rubric  Excellent  7-9 A score in this range indicates a well-thought-out response that demonstrates a clear understanding of
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,The statement is a moral one and it is generally accepted that morality is subjective to a certain extent. However the core idea of the statement is that inaction can be as harmful as action which is a widely held belief.  In the context of the given scale a 1 would indicate that the respondent strongly disagrees with the statement meaning they believe that inaction is not as harmful as active harm. A 7 would indicate that the respondent strongly agrees with the statement meaning they believe that inaction can be just as harmful as active harm.  The majority of people would likely fall somewhere in the middle of the scale with a 4 indicating that they neither agree nor disagree with the statement
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,I'm a 6.  I think it's important to have a certain amount of money saved up for emergencies and to be able to live comfortably. However once you have that safety net in place it's hard to argue against the idea of donating any additional funds to help those in need.  I'm not saying that everyone should give away all their money but if you have more than you need it's a good idea to consider how you can use that money to make a positive impact on the world.  There are many organizations out there that are doing great work and your donations can help them continue to provide effective help to those who need it the most

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,The statement is a hypothetical one and it is difficult to determine the exact circumstances in which it would be applicable. However I would lean towards disagreeing with the statement. While it is possible that political oppression could be used to achieve short-term goals the long-term consequences of such actions are often detrimental to the overall well-being and happiness of the people.  Additionally the use of political oppression is a slippery slope as it can easily lead to abuse of power and the erosion of democratic principles. It is important to consider alternative methods of achieving the desired outcomes such as education dialogue and policy changes which may be more effective in the long run and
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm curious to see the results of this question.  I'm not going to answer the question myself but I'm interested in the reasons people might choose a certain answer.  I'm also curious to see if the answers would be different if the question was about torturing a guilty person instead of an innocent one.  I'm not trying to start a debate I'm just curious to see the results.  Edit: I'm not going to answer the question myself but I'm interested in the reasons people might choose a certain answer.  I'm also curious to see if the
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,I'm not sure if I can give a number to this but I'll try. I think it depends on the situation. If the alternative is a much larger loss of life then it may be morally necessary. However I don't think it's a simple yes or no answer.  4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree  ## Information  Seller Apps by Jorel Size 1.1 MB Category Lifestyle Compatibility iPhone     Requires iOS 10.0 or later. iPad     Requires iPadOS 10.0 or later. iPod touch     Requires iOS 10.
