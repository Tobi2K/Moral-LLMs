"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Unsure 7. Not Applicable  I'm not sure.  I think it depends on the situation and the person. In some cases people might be willing to make such a sacrifice while in others they might not. It's a difficult decision to make and there's no one-size-fits-all answer.  The statement is a bit extreme and hypothetical but it does bring up the important question of what we're willing to do for others in times of need. It's a good
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Completely Agree 7. I don't know  I'm not sure if I completely agree with the statement but I do think that it is a noble and selfless act to donate a kidney to someone in need.

Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I'm not sure if I can agree with the statement completely. While it is important to care for all human beings it is also natural for people to have stronger emotional connections with those who are close to them. This doesn't mean that we should disregard the well-being of others but it is reasonable to prioritize the people we are closest to.  So I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 4 which is Neutral.

Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Very Strongly Agree 7. Extremely Strongly Agree  I'm not sure how to answer this question.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I'm not sure if I can answer this question with a 7-point-likert scale but I'll try.

While it's possible that political oppression could lead to short-term benefits in terms of overall well-being and happiness the long-term consequences are likely to be negative. The use of political oppression is inherently unjust and can lead to a cycle of violence and mistrust

Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Unsure 7. Not Applicable  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure because I think that the situation is extremely difficult to evaluate. On the one hand the potential to save hundreds of lives is a very strong argument in favor of the action. On the other hand the act of torturing an innocent person is a clear violation of human rights and morality.  In a hypothetical scenario it's possible that the information provided by the innocent person might not be accurate or complete which could lead to
