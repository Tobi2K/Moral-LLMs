"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 6 - Agree (While I have reservations about making such a decision for everyone in some extreme circumstances sacrificing one's leg to save a life can be considered morally required.)
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree.  Explanation: While I understand the logic behind the statement I do not fully agree that we should feel morally obligated to give one of our kidneys to someone in need. Although we can survive with only one kidney the decision to donate an organ should be voluntary and based on personal choice rather than a moral obligation.
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 5 - Somewhat Agree. While I believe people should care about the well-being of all it's unrealistic to expect complete detachment from those close to us.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 6 - Agree.
