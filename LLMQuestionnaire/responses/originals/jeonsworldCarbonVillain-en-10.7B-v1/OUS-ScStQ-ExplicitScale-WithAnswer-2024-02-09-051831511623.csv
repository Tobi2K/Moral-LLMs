"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 6 - Agree. In a situation where saving another person's life is the only option and it requires sacrificing one's own leg the moral imperative to preserve human life would likely outweigh the value of one's own limb. This is based on the principle of utilitarianism which prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number of people.
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree. While the statement raises a valid point about the functional capacity of one kidney the obligation to donate an organ is a complex ethical issue that involves personal autonomy informed consent and potential risks associated with the donation process.
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 6 - Agree. While it is natural for individuals to have stronger emotional connections to certain people from a moral perspective it is important to recognize the inherent value and dignity of all human life. This means that people should strive to care about the well-being of all human beings equally regardless of their proximity or relationship.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 6 - Agree. While the act of causing harm is inherently negative the concept of not providing help when one has the ability to do so can also have negative consequences for others. Both actions can result in suffering and can be considered morally wrong.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,, 6 - Agree. While personal finance decisions are subjective I believe that using resources to help those in need and make a significant positive impact on their lives is generally considered morally commendable.
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree (This answer reflects a neutral stance on the statement recognizing the complexity and nuance of moral dilemmas.)
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree (This statement presents a complex ethical dilemma and the justification for using political oppression for a short period to achieve long-term well-being and happiness is debatable and would require further context and analysis.)
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While the intention to save hundreds of lives is understandable using torture as a means to obtain information goes against ethical and moral principles as well as legal standards. There are alternative methods to gather information without resorting to torture which are more in line with human rights and values.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree (This statement raises complex ethical questions and can be debated based on specific circumstances and the overall consequences.)
