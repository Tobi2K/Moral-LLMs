"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,Answer: 6 - Agree. While this decision would be extremely difficult and personally devastating the potential to save another person's life is a morally significant reason to make such a sacrifice.
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,Answer: 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree (While I recognize the potential benefits of organ donation and the fact that one kidney can sustain a healthy life I believe the decision to donate should ultimately be based on personal choice and circumstances rather than a strict moral obligation.)
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,Answer: 6 - Agree. While it is natural for individuals to have stronger emotional connections to certain people from a moral perspective it is important to recognize the inherent value and dignity of all human life. This means that people should strive to care about the well-being of all human beings equally regardless of their proximity or relationship.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,Answer: 6 - Agree.

It is important to take responsibility for our actions and inactions and strive to make a positive impact on others whenever possible.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,Answer: 6 - Agree.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,Answer: 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While the overall well-being and happiness of the people are important political oppression is generally considered a violation of human rights and can lead to long-term negative consequences. It is essential to explore alternative methods to achieve the desired outcomes without sacrificing fundamental freedoms and rights.
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,Answer: 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While the potential harm caused by the bomb is a serious concern the use of torture as a means to obtain information raises significant ethical and moral questions. There are alternative methods to gather information without resorting to such extreme measures even in extreme situations.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,Answer: 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While I recognize that in certain extreme situations collateral damage may unfortunately occur I believe that every effort should be made to minimize harm to innocent people even if it means sacrificing potential gains. The value of human life should be prioritized above all else.
