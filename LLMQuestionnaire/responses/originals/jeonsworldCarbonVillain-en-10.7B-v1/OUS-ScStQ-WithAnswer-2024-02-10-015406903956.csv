"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 6 (Somewhat Agree)
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 3 (Neutral)  Justification: This statement presents an egalitarian viewpoint suggesting that people should prioritize the well-being of all humans equally without showing preference for those closer to them. While this perspective has merit it is also important to recognize the natural human tendency to prioritize those in one's immediate social circle. As a result I find myself leaning towards a neutral stance acknowledging the value of both perspectives.

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 1 (Strongly Disagree)  Justification: The statement suggests that the death of innocent people can be justified if it results in the greater good.

Innocent lives should not be considered as acceptable losses regardless of the potential benefits.
