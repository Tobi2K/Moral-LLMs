"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 6 (Agree)
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 5 - Somewhat Agree. While it is true that one kidney can maintain proper bodily function there are still risks and considerations associated with organ donation. This statement simplifies the complexities of medical ethics and the potential consequences for the donor.
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 6 - Agree.   Justification: While it is natural for people to have stronger emotional connections to those close to them promoting equality and considering the well-being of all human beings regardless of their proximity to us is a fundamental aspect of moral values and ethical principles.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree (Explanation: This response indicates that the individual does not lean towards strongly agreeing or disagreeing with the statement as the moral complexity of this situation can vary depending on the specific circumstances and the extent of the benefits and harms involved.)
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree.   Justification: While the statement presents a potential trade-off between political oppression and overall well-being the use of oppression even for a limited time can have long-lasting negative consequences on society and individual rights. The potential harm and ethical concerns associated with political oppression outweigh the potential benefits in this scenario leading to a somewhat disagreement with the statement.
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree (Explanation: While the intention to save hundreds of lives is understandable the use of torture as a means to obtain information raises ethical and moral concerns. It is important to consider alternative methods that do not involve infringing on human rights and dignity.)
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.
