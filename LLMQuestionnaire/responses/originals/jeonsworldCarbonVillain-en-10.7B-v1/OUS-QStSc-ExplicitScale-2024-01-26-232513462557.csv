"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,Answer: 6 - Agree. While sacrificing one's own limb is a difficult and extreme decision the principle of utilitarianism which prioritizes the greatest happiness for the greatest number would support the idea that saving a life is morally superior to preserving one's own limb. In an emergency situation where the only option is to save another person's life by sacrificing one's leg it can be argued that one is morally required to make this sacrifice.
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,Answer:  [Your chosen number]   Justification: This question asks for a personal moral stance on the issue of kidney donation. The answer would vary based on individual beliefs and values. The statement suggests that since humans can survive with only one kidney it is our moral obligation to donate one to someone in need. Depending on whether you believe in the concept of altruism and the importance of helping others your answer could range from strongly disagreeing to strongly agreeing.
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,Answer: 6 - Agree. While it is natural for people to have stronger emotional connections with those close to them it is important to recognize the inherent value and dignity of all human life. Caring for the well-being of all humans equally promotes a more just and compassionate world.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,Answer: 6 - Agree. While not directly causing harm is different from actively helping someone neglecting to help someone in need can still have negative consequences. There is a moral responsibility to assist others when possible and failing to do so can be considered a form of indirect harm.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,Answer: 6 - Agree. While I believe that individuals have the right to use their resources as they see fit I also think that when someone has more than they need and can make a significant positive impact on others' lives by donating it is morally commendable to do so.
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,Answer: 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While I understand the concept of utilitarianism which prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number I believe that intentionally causing harm to one individual even if it benefits others is ethically problematic. There are other ethical frameworks such as deontology which emphasize the importance of respecting individual rights and moral absolutes regardless of the consequences. In this context the principle of non-maleficence which states that one should not intentionally harm others is a central tenet in many ethical systems.
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,Answer: 2 - Disagree. While it may seem like a short-term use of political oppression could potentially lead to some short-term benefits it often comes at the cost of fundamental human rights and freedoms. In the long run political oppression can lead to resentment unrest and further negative consequences. A more sustainable approach to ensuring overall well-being and happiness would be to focus on building a society based on democratic values human rights and social justice.
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,Answer: 1 - Strongly Disagree. While the intention to prevent a tragedy is understandable using torture on an innocent person is a violation of human rights and ethical principles. There are alternative methods to gather information without resorting to such extreme measures.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,Answer: 2 - Disagree. While it is understandable to prioritize saving as many lives as possible intentionally causing harm to innocent people even if it results in a greater overall good is ethically problematic and often leads to a slippery slope in moral decision-making.
