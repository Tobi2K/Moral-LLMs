"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 7 (Strongly Agree)  Justification: The statement presents a situation where the only option to save another person's life is by sacrificing one's own leg. In moral principles the value of human life is generally considered to be of utmost importance. In this scenario the action of sacrificing one's leg would prevent the loss of another person's life. This aligns with the principle of utilitarianism which prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Therefore based on the moral principle of preserving human life I strongly agree with the statement.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 1 (Strongly Disagree)  Justification: The act of torturing an innocent person regardless of the potential consequences goes against fundamental human rights and moral values. Even in extreme situations the principle of not inflicting harm on innocent individuals should be upheld. There are alternative methods and approaches to gathering information that do not involve violating human rights.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 1 (Strongly Disagree)  Justification: The statement presents a moral dilemma where the potential for saving more lives comes at the cost of innocent lives. While the intention may be to minimize overall harm the idea of intentionally causing harm to innocent people even if it results in a greater good is fundamentally against the principles of justice and morality. Therefore I strongly disagree with the statement.
