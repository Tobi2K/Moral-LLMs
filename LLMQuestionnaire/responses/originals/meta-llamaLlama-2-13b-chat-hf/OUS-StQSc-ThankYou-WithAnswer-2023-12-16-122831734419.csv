"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,  1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Neither Agree nor Disagree 4 - Agree 5 - Strongly Agree  Please choose a number from 1 to 5 to indicate your level of agreement with the statement.
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,  I agree with the statement to some extent. While I believe that all human beings have inherent value and should be treated with respect and dignity I also recognize that there are limits to my ability to care for everyone equally. I have a natural inclination to prioritize the well-being of my family and close friends and I believe that this is a common and understandable human tendency. However I also recognize that this inclination should not come at the expense of the well-being of others and I strive to balance my personal relationships with a broader sense of compassion and empathy for all people.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 6 (Somewhat Agree)  I believe that failing to help someone in need can be just as harmful as actively harming them. When we fail to help we are effectively allowing harm to continue which can have long-lasting and devastating consequences. For example if someone is being bullied and we fail to intervene we are essentially allowing the bullying to continue which can lead to serious emotional and psychological damage. Similarly if someone is struggling with a mental health issue and we fail to offer support we are denying them the help they need to recover.  Therefore I agree with the statement that it is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,"  I do not agree with the statement. I would rate it as a 1 out of 7 as I do not believe it is morally right to harm an innocent person even if it is for the greater good. The principle of ""do no harm"" is a fundamental aspect of ethical decision-making and intentionally harming one person to help others goes against this principle. Instead I would look for alternative solutions that do not involve harming anyone."
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,  I do not agree with the statement.  I believe that political oppression even if it is for a short limited period is never an acceptable solution to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people. Political oppression is a form of coercion and manipulation and it can lead to long-lasting negative consequences such as loss of individual freedoms social unrest and economic stagnation.  Instead of political oppression I believe that governments should focus on creating an environment that fosters social and economic progress while also protecting the rights and freedoms of all individuals. This can be achieved through policies that promote transparency accountability
