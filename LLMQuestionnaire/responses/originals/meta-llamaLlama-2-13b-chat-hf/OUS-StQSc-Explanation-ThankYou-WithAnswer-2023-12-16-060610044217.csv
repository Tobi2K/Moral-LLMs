"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,  6. Strongly Disagree  Please provide your reasons for disagreeing with the statement in the space provided below:  I strongly disagree with the statement because it is not morally justifiable to prioritize one's own life over another person's life especially in a situation where both lives are at risk.
