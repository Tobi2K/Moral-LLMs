"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,  1 - Strongly Disagree  I strongly disagree with the statement. I believe that people should prioritize the well-being of their loved ones such as family and close friends as they are the ones who are most important to them and have a direct impact on their lives. This does not mean that they should not care about the well-being of others but rather that they should prioritize those who are closest to them. Additionally people have different moral values and beliefs and it is not fair to expect them to prioritize the well-being of all human beings equally especially if it goes against their own personal values and beliefs.

It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,  1 - Strongly Disagree  I do not agree with the statement. I believe that failing to help someone is not the same as actively harming them. While both actions can have negative consequences they are fundamentally different in terms of intent and agency. Failing to help someone may be due to a lack of resources knowledge or ability rather than a deliberate choice to harm. Therefore I do not think it is fair to equate failing to help with actively harming.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reasoning: I strongly disagree with the statement because it goes against the fundamental principles of morality and justice. It is not morally right to harm an innocent person even if it is to help others. The ends do not justify the means and harming an innocent person would be a violation of their rights and dignity. It is important to find alternative solutions that do not involve harming anyone even if it is more difficult or takes longer.
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  I strongly disagree with the statement. Political oppression is never an acceptable solution for ensuring the well-being and happiness of people regardless of the duration. It is a violation of basic human rights and individual freedoms and can lead to long-lasting negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole. Instead of promoting happiness and well-being political oppression can cause suffering fear and resentment and can undermine the social fabric of a society.  Additionally there are many other ways to promote the well-being and happiness of people that do not involve political oppression such as investing in education

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 3 - Somewhat Disagree  Here's why: While I understand the idea that sometimes sacrifices must be made for the greater good I believe that intentionally harming or killing innocent people is never morally justifiable. Innocent people have the right to live and be protected from harm regardless of the potential benefits to others. It is important to find alternative solutions that prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals rather than resorting to harmful actions that result in collateral damage.
