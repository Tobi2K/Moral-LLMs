It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,  I cannot endorse or encourage any form of torture or violence regardless of the circumstances. Torture is a violation of human rights and fundamental principles of human dignity and it is not an effective means of obtaining accurate information. The use of torture can lead to false confessions and misinformation and it can cause long-lasting physical and psychological harm to the victim.
