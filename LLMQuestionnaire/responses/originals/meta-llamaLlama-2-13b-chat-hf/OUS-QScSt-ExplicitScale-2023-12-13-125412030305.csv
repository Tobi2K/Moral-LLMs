"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,I would rate this statement as a 6 - Agree.

It is not necessarily a moral obligation to donate a kidney but rather a personal choice that can be motivated by a desire to help others. Additionally there are risks and potential complications associated with kidney donation and these should be carefully considered before making a decision.
