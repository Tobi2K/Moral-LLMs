Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,"  1 - Strongly Disagree  I do not think it is ever morally justifiable to intentionally sacrifice innocent lives even if it would result in a greater good for more people. The value of human life is inherent and inviolable and it is not appropriate to weigh one life against another based on utilitarian calculations. The ends do not justify the means when it comes to taking innocent lives.  Moreover the idea of ""collateral damage"" is a euphemism that dehumanizes and devalues the lives of those who are caught in the crossfire. It is important to acknowledge the human cost of our actions and to work towards finding solutions"
