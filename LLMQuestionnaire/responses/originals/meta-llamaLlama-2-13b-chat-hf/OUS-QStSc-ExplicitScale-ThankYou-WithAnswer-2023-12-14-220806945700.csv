"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 6 - Strongly Agree  The statement suggests that in an emergency situation where sacrificing one's own leg is the only way to save another person's life it is morally required to make this sacrifice. I strongly agree with this statement. In such a situation the well-being and survival of the other person should take precedence over one's own physical well-being and limb. The moral obligation to prioritize the other person's life over one's own leg is evident.
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,  I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  While I understand the moral argument that we only need one kidney to be healthy and that donating a kidney to someone in need could be seen as a selfless act of kindness I do not think that it is morally obligatory to do so. The decision to donate an organ is a personal one and should be made based on individual circumstances and beliefs.  Furthermore I believe that it is important to consider the potential risks and consequences of organ donation including the risk of complications during the donation process and the potential long-term health
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,  I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree. While I understand the idea that people should care about the well-being of all human beings equally I believe that it is natural for people to prioritize the well-being of those who are closest to them such as family and friends. This does not mean that I disagree with the idea of caring for the well-being of all people but rather that I recognize the importance of personal relationships and the emotional connections that we have with those closest to us.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,  I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 6 Strongly Agree. I believe that failing to help someone in need can be just as harmful and wrong as actively harming them especially if the person has a genuine expectation that you will provide assistance. Not meeting their expectations can lead to feelings of betrayal mistrust and further harm.  For example if a friend is going through a difficult time and reaches out to you for support and you fail to provide it this can damage the friendship and lead to long-term negative consequences. Similarly if a colleague is struggling with a task and relies on you to help and you fail to do so
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,  I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 6 - Strongly Agree. I believe that it is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn't really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal. This is because the money could be used to improve the lives of those who are in need and not using it for this purpose could be seen as wasteful and selfish. Additionally donating to effective causes can have a positive impact on society and can help to address important issues such as poverty inequality and social injustice. Overall I believe that it is important to use one's resources to help others and make
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,  I would rate my answer as a 2 - Disagree. While I understand the idea of sacrificing one person for the greater good I do not believe it is morally right to intentionally harm an innocent person even if it would benefit others. It is important to prioritize the well-being and autonomy of all individuals rather than using them as means to an end. Additionally there may be alternative solutions that do not involve harming innocent people and it is our responsibility to explore those options before resorting to harmful actions.
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Political oppression by definition involves the use of force or coercion to suppress dissent and limit individual freedoms. It is not a viable or ethical means of ensuring the overall well-being and happiness of the people. In fact political oppression can have the opposite effect leading to widespread suffering resentment and social unrest.  There are many other ways to promote the well-being and happiness of the people that do not involve political oppression. These can include:  1. Promoting economic development and social justice through fair policies and regulations. 2. Providing access to
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,  I strongly disagree with the statement. Torturing an innocent person is never justified regardless of the circumstances. The ends do not justify the means. It is important to find alternative methods to obtain information that do not involve inflicting harm and violating human rights. The use of torture is not only morally reprehensible but it is also illegal and can lead to false confessions and unreliable information. In the long run it can cause more harm than good and undermine the rule of law and human rights.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,  I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 2 - Disagree. I do not believe that it is ever morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage even if more people are saved overall. The intentional killing of innocent people is always wrong and can never be justified. The ends do not justify the means in such cases. It is important to find alternative solutions that minimize harm and respect the inherent worth and dignity of all human beings even if it means that some people may not be saved.
