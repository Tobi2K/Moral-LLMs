"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,  I agree with the statement.

Similarly during a period of economic crisis a government may need to impose strict austerity measures to reduce spending and balance the budget. In both cases political oppression may be necessary to achieve the greater good of protecting the people from harm.
