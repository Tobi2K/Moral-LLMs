"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, Yes I agree with the statement.  Reason: The statement is based on the principle of utilitarianism which states that the morally right action is the one that maximizes happiness or minimizes suffering. In this case the sacrifice of one's own leg would save another person's life which would result in a net increase in happiness. Therefore the statement is correct.

It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,, I agree with the statement.  Reason: The statement is true because it is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal. This is because money is a valuable resource that can be used to help others in need and it is morally wrong to keep it for oneself when there are people who could benefit from it. Additionally donating money to causes that provide effective help to those in need can have a significant impact on the lives of those who receive it and it is morally right to do so. Therefore I agree with the statement.
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, I disagree with the statement.  Reason: The statement implies that harming an innocent person is morally acceptable if it is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people. However this is not always the case. In some situations harming an innocent person may be morally wrong even if it is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people. For example if a doctor must amputate a healthy limb to save the life of a patient this would be morally wrong even if it is a necessary means to saving the patient's life.  Therefore I disagree with the statement because it implies that harming an innocent person is morally acceptable
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Political oppression is a form of violence and coercion that is used to control people and suppress their rights and freedoms. It is a means of maintaining power and control over a population but it does not necessarily lead to the overall well-being and happiness of the people. In fact political oppression can have the opposite effect leading to increased levels of stress anxiety and depression among the population.  Furthermore political oppression is often used to silence dissent and prevent people from expressing their opinions and ideas. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and a lack of creativity which
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Torture is a cruel and inhumane practice that should never be used as a means to obtain information. It is a violation of human rights and can lead to serious psychological and physical harm to the victim. Innocent people are not guilty of any crime and should not be subjected to such treatment.  Moreover the use of torture to obtain information is not a reliable method. It can lead to false confessions and misleading information. In addition it can create a culture of fear and intimidation which can undermine the rule of law and democracy.  Finally the use of torture to
