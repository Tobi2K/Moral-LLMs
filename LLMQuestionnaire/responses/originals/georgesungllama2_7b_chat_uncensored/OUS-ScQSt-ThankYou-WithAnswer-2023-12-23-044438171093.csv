If the statement is about using political oppression to achieve a specific goal such as to achieve a certain political outcome then I"
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, The statement is not true. Torture is never permissible. It is a violation of human rights and international law.  The statement implies that the torture of an innocent person is justified if it would prevent a bomb from going off that would kill hundreds of people. This is a false dilemma as there are other options available to prevent the bomb from going off. For example the authorities could use non-violent means such as surveillance interrogation or negotiations to obtain the information they need.  Furthermore even if the torture of an innocent person would prevent a bomb from going off it would still be a violation of human
