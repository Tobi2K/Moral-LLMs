"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,  I agree with the statement.  Reason:  The statement is based on the principle of utilitarianism which states that the morally right action is the one that maximizes happiness or minimizes suffering. In this case sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life would result in a greater good as it would save the life of another person. Therefore it is morally required to make this sacrifice.  However there may be other factors to consider such as the severity of the injury the availability of medical resources and the person's own wishes. In some cases it may be more appropriate to prioritize the person's own well
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, The statement is true. We only need one kidney to survive but we need two to be healthy. Therefore if we are able to donate one of our kidneys we should feel obliged to do so.  I would rate my agreement with the statement as 7 on a 7-point-likert scale.
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, I agree with the statement.  Reason: The statement is true in the sense that people should not favor the well-being of people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally. This is because it is not fair to others who are not as close to them. It is also important to consider the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally regardless of their proximity to us.  However I do not think that this statement is necessarily true in practice. In reality people often do favor the well-being of people who are especially close to them whether physically or emotionally. This is because we have a natural tendency to care more

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Harming an innocent person is never morally right. Even if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people it is still morally wrong to harm an innocent person.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Political oppression is a form of violence and coercion that is used to control people and suppress their rights and freedoms. It is a means of maintaining power and control over a population but it does not necessarily lead to the overall well-being and happiness of the people. In fact political oppression can have the opposite effect leading to increased poverty inequality and social unrest.  Furthermore the use of political oppression is often short-sighted and does not take into account the long-term consequences of such actions. It can lead to a cycle of violence and repression that is difficult
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, I do not agree with the statement.  Reason: Torture is a cruel and inhumane practice that should be avoided at all costs. It is not a viable solution to prevent a bomb from going off that would kill hundreds of people. There are other methods that can be used to gather information without resorting to torture.  Moreover torture is illegal in most countries and is considered a war crime under international law. It is also a violation of human rights and can lead to long-term psychological damage to the victim.  In conclusion torture is not an acceptable solution to prevent a bomb from going off that would kill hundreds of people. There are other methods that can
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,  I agree with the statement.  Reason:  Collateral damage is an unfortunate but sometimes necessary consequence of war. If more people are saved overall it is morally justifiable to accept collateral damage as a necessary evil.
