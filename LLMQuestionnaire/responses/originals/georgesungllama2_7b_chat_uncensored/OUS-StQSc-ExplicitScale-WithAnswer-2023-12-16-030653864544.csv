"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reason: The statement assumes that the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg. However there are many other ways to save a person’s life such as using a defibrillator administering CPR or calling for medical assistance. Sacrificing one’s own leg may be necessary in some extreme cases but it should not be the only option considered.  2 - Disagree  Reason: While it is true that sacrificing one’s own leg may be necessary in some extreme cases it is not always the best option. There are many
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reason: From a moral point of view we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive but really only one to be healthy. However this statement does not take into account the fact that the person with kidney failure may have other health issues that require treatment such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Additionally the statement does not consider the emotional and physical toll that donating a kidney can have on the donor. Therefore while it is true that we do not need two kidneys to survive we should not feel
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reason: I believe that people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally but I also believe that there are certain circumstances where people may favor the well-being of those who are especially close to them. For example a parent may prioritize the well-being of their children over the well-being of strangers. Similarly a spouse may prioritize the well-being of their partner over the well-being of strangers. In these cases I believe that it is natural and understandable for people to prioritize the well-being of those who are close to them.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reason: The statement implies that failing to help someone is the same as actively harming them. This is not true. Failing to help someone can be a result of many factors such as lack of resources or knowledge and it is not necessarily the same as actively harming them.  2 - Disagree  Reason: While failing to help someone can be a result of many factors it can also be a result of intentional harm. In some cases failing to help someone can be a result of discrimination or prejudice which is a form of active harm.  3 - Somewhat Disagree 
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,," 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reason: I believe that it is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal. However I also believe that it is important to have some savings and emergency funds in case of unexpected expenses or emergencies. Therefore I would rate this statement as ""Neither Agree nor Disagree"" because I believe that it is important to have some savings and emergency funds but I also believe that it is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help"
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reason: The statement implies that harming an innocent person is morally acceptable if it is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people. This is a dangerous and unethical position to take. It suggests that the ends justify the means which is a fundamental principle of utilitarianism. However this is not a valid justification for harming an innocent person. Innocent people have intrinsic value and should not be harmed simply to achieve a greater good.  ### 2. Ethical Dilemma: You are a doctor and you have a patient who is suffering from a terminal illness. The patient has requested
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reason: Political oppression is a means of controlling people and suppressing their rights and freedoms. It is not a means of ensuring the overall well-being and happiness of the people. In fact political oppression often leads to the opposite effect as it can create a climate of fear and mistrust which can be detrimental to the overall well-being and happiness of the people.  2 - Disagree  Reason: While political oppression may be necessary in some extreme cases such as during a war or a natural disaster it should not be used as a means of ens
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reason: Torture is never permissible regardless of the consequences.  ### 2. Ethical Dilemma: A doctor is treating a patient who is in critical condition and needs a life-saving surgery. However the patient is allergic to the anesthesia that will be used during the surgery. If the doctor does not perform the surgery the patient will die. If the doctor performs the surgery without using the anesthesia the patient will suffer severe pain during the surgery.  Do you think the doctor should perform the surgery without using the anesthesia?  
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 1 - Strongly Disagree  Reason: Collateral damage is never morally necessary. It is always a tragic consequence of war and violence.  ### 2. Ethical Dilemma: Should a person who has committed a serious crime be given a second chance?
