Reason: The statement is based on the principle of utilitarianism which states that the morally right action is the one that maximizes happiness or minimizes suffering. In this case the sacrifice of one’s own leg would save another person’s life which would result in a net increase in happiness. Therefore the sacrifice would be morally required.

Additionally there may be other options available such as seeking medical attention or using a prosthetic leg that could

It simply means that it is morally right to do so if it is necessary

It can also lead to a decrease in economic growth and a decrease in the overall well-being of the people.  Overall I believe that political oppression should not be used as a means to achieve the

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, Yes I agree with the statement.
