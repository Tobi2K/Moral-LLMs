It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 5  Comment: While I understand the logic behind utilitarianism and the idea that the greatest good for the greatest number should be prioritized I still feel uneasy about intentionally causing harm to an innocent person even if it benefits others.
