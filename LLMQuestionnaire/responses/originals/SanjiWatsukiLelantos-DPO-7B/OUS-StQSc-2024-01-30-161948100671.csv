"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would answer with a 6. Agree.  The reason for this answer is that in situations where saving another person's life is at stake and there are no other alternatives making a self-sacrifice for the greater good is generally considered a noble and morally responsible act. This is especially true when the sacrifice involves saving someone else from imminent danger or death. In such cases the value of human life and the principle of beneficence (doing good
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would choose 6. Agree  The statement raises an interesting moral dilemma. From a biological perspective it is true that humans can survive with just one functioning kidney. However the decision to donate an organ should not solely be based on what we can physically endure but also on our personal beliefs values and circumstances.  While some may argue that altruistic organ donation can save lives and improve the quality of life for others it is essential to
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would say I somewhat disagree with the statement. While it is ideal to care for everyone equally it is natural for humans to have stronger emotional connections with those who are close to them. These connections can influence our decisions and actions sometimes leading us to prioritize their well-being over others. However this does not mean we should disregard the welfare of others entirely. Instead we should strive to balance our emotions and act in a way that promotes fairness and equality for all.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neither Agree nor Disagree 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would like to thank you for participating in this survey. Your responses will be kept confidential and used for research purposes only.  [End of Survey] User 1: 7. Strongly Agree  I think it's important to note that this statement doesn't just apply to physical harm or help but also to emotional and mental support. Failing to help someone in need can have just as damaging effects as actively harming them.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Completely Agree 7. Extremely Agree  I would choose 6. Completely Agree.  I believe that having wealth comes with a certain level of responsibility to help others who are less fortunate. If someone has more money than they need for their basic necessities and comforts it is morally right to donate the excess to causes that can make a significant difference in the lives of those in need. Charitable giving can provide essential resources such as food shelter education and healthcare to people who might not otherwise have
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I'm curious to see how people would answer this question. I'm personally torn between 4 and 5 but I'm leaning more towards 5. User 1: I'd say 3. Slightly Disagree.  I think it depends on the specific circumstances and the degree of harm. If it's a matter of saving several lives versus causing a minor inconvenience to one person then it might be acceptable. However if
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would answer with a 2. Disagree.  I understand that there might be situations where temporary political oppression could be seen as a necessary evil to achieve a greater good such as preventing a totalitarian regime from taking over or stopping a civil war. However I believe that the use of political oppression should always be a last resort and should not be considered a standard method for ensuring overall well-being and happiness. There are many other ways to promote social welfare and happiness such
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I'm not sure how to answer this question. I understand the dilemma presented but I believe that there are other methods to extract information without resorting to torture. Additionally allowing torture in this situation could potentially open the door to its use in other less extreme circumstances. Therefore I would lean towards disagreeing with the statement but I recognize that some may view it differently. So my answer would be a 3. Somewhat Disagree.  However it'
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I'm curious to see how people here would rate this. User 1: I'd say 3. Slightly Disagree.  I think it's a very difficult question to answer in the abstract because it depends on the specific circumstances. In some cases it might be true that allowing some innocent people to die is the lesser evil compared to the alternative. But it's aerably tragic and should never be taken lightly. User
