"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,5 - Somewhat Agree  I believe that in an extreme situation where saving another person's life is the only option and requires sacrificing one's own limb an individual should consider making that sacrifice.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,I'm going to choose 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.
