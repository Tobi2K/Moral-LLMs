"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, 6 - Agree  I believe that from a moral perspective people should strive to care for the well-being of all human beings equally.
