"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 7  The question asks about the moral obligation in a life-or-death situation where one has to choose between saving another person's life and sacrificing their own leg.

"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 3  The statement raises an interesting ethical question but it's essential to consider various factors before making a definitive judgment.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 1 (Strongly Disagree)  The use of political oppression even if it is for a short limited period goes against the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights. While it may seem like a temporary solution to achieve overall well-being and happiness it sets a dangerous precedent and can lead to long-term negative consequences.

Moreover it is difficult to determine the exact duration of such oppression and there is always a risk of it becoming prolonged or even permanent.

In these situations it is crucial to weigh the consequences of allowing innocent lives to be lost against the potential benefits for the greater good. This decision should not
