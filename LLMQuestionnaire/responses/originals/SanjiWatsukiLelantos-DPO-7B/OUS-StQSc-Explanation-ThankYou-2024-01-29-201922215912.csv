It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  I chose 4 - Neutral User 1: I'm curious as to why you chose neutral.
