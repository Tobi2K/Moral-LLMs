"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,I'm not sure how to implement this in my code.

"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,"I'm not sure if this is the best way to phrase the question but I'm looking for a way to measure how much people agree with the idea that moral obligations should be distributed equally among all humans regardless of their relationship to the person.

It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,I'm not sure if this is the best way to phrase the question but I'm looking for a way to measure people's agreement with the statement.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,"I'm not sure if this is the best way to phrase the question but I'm looking for a way to ask about the moral acceptability of causing harm to one person to save multiple others. User 1: I would suggest something like:  ""In a situation where causing harm to one innocent person is the only way to prevent significant harm to multiple other innocent people how morally acceptable do you find it to cause harm to that one individual?""  This phrasing allows for a more nuanced response as it acknowledges the gravity of the situation and the potential harm to multiple people. It also asks about the moral acceptability rather than rightness which may allow for a broader range of responses. "
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,"I'm not sure if this is the best way to phrase the question but I'm looking for a way to ask about the acceptability of political oppression for the greater good.

This phrasing allows respondents to consider the degree to which they find such actions acceptable rather than forcing them to choose between agreeing or disagreeing with the statement as a whole.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,Comment: This question is asking about the ethics of torture not about the effectiveness of torture as a means of gathering information.  Comment: @Fizz - I think the question is asking about the ethics of torture in a specific situation where the stakes are very high. It's not asking about torture in general but rather about whether the ends justify the means in this particular case.  Comment: @JAB - I agree that the question is asking about the ethics of torture in a specific situation but it's still asking about the ethics not the effectiveness.  Comment: @Fizz - I see your point but I think the effectiveness is implicit in the question. If torture
