Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would rate this as a 4. Neutral. While it is true that we only need one functioning kidney to survive there are many factors to consider before making such a decision.

Question: How important is it for individuals to prioritize their own well-being over the well-being of others? Please answer using a 7-point-likert scale.  1
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neither Agree nor Disagree 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would rate this as a 6. Agree.  I think that failing to help someone when you have the ability to do so can have negative consequences for the person in need. While it may not be as direct or intentional as actively harming someone it can still lead to suffering or missed opportunities. Therefore I believe that not assisting someone when you could is morally wrong in many situations.  However there might be some nuances and
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,,"1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would rate this as a 6. Agree.  I think it's important to recognize that everyone's financial situation is different and what one person may consider as ""not really needing"" money could be vastly different from another person's perspective. However if someone has excess funds that they aren't using for their own necessities or future goals it seems reasonable to consider donating that money to causes that can make a significant impact on others' lives. There are"
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would rate this as a 3. Somewhat Disagree. While I understand the utilitarian argument that the greatest good for the greatest number should be considered I still have reservations about intentionally harming an innocent person even if it benefits others. There are other ways to approach situations that may avoid causing harm to anyone.  However it's essential to note that this is a complex issue and people's opinions may vary depending on their moral framework and personal beliefs.
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would rate this as a 2. Disagree. While it may be tempting to consider political oppression as a means to achieve short-term stability or order it is crucial to recognize the long-term consequences and potential damage to fundamental human rights and freedoms. Additionally there are alternative methods to address societal issues without resorting to oppression.  In a democracy the primary goal should be to foster an environment where citizens can freely express their opinions engage in open dialogue
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would choose 1. Strongly Disagree.  The reason for this choice is that the principle of non-maleficence in medical ethics prohibits causing harm to others even if the intended outcome is beneficial. Torture is a form of physical and psychological abuse that violates human rights and dignity. Furthermore the effectiveness of torture in obtaining accurate information is questionable as people may provide false information to stop the torture. There are alternative methods such as psychological interrog
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would rate this as a 3. Somewhat Disagree. While I understand the concept of collateral damage in warfare and its necessity in some situations I still find it difficult to fully agree with the statement. The loss of innocent lives is always tragic and should be avoided if possible. However in certain circumstances where the greater good is at stake it may be necessary to accept some collateral damage. But this should never be the preferred option and every effort should be made to minimize such
