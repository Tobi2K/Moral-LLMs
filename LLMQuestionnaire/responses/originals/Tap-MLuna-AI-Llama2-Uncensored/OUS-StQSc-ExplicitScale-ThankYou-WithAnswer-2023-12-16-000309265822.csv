"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 6 - Agree  I agree with the statement because it presents a scenario where one person's life is in danger and the only way to save them is by sacrificing one's own leg. In this situation the person's life is more important than their own physical well-being and therefore it is morally required to make the sacrifice. However I would like to add that this scenario is extreme and rare and in most cases other options should be explored before resorting to such a drastic measure.
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 7 - Strongly Agree
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,                                                                                                                                                      
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 6 - Agree  I believe that the statement is generally true. It is certainly better to help someone than to harm them but failing to help someone can also have negative consequences. For example if someone is in danger and you fail to intervene they may suffer serious harm or even death. Therefore while it is not as bad as actively harming someone failing to help them can still have significant negative consequences.
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,, 6 - Agree  I agree with the statement because it is true that having more money than one needs can be a moral issue. If one has excess money they can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal. By doing so they can make a positive impact on someone else's life which is a moral act. However I would add that it is not always necessary to donate all excess money as some people may choose to save or invest it for future use.
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 7 - Strongly Agree  Note: This question is not about the morality of harming an innocent person in general. It is specifically about the morality of harming an innocent person if it is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 7 - Strongly Agree
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, 7 (Strongly Agree)
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,," 6 - Agree  Note: This question was inspired by a quote from the philosopher Peter Singer who wrote ""It is always wrong to kill an innocent person. Therefore if there are no innocent people in a war then there is no justification for fighting that war."""
