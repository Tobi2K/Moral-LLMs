"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,  1 - Strongly Disagree  I do not think it is morally right to give up one of our kidneys to someone else regardless of whether they have kidney failure or not.
