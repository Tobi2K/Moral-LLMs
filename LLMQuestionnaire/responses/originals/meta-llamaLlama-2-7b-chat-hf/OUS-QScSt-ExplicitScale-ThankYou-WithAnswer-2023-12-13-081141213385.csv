"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,,  1 - Strongly Disagree  I do not think it is morally right to give one of my kidneys to someone else regardless of their health status. Each person has their own body and the right to make decisions about their own health. While it is true that we do not need two kidneys to survive it is also important to consider the potential risks and complications associated with organ donation. Additionally there are other ways to help people with kidney failure such as through financial support or advocacy for improved access to healthcare.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, 6 - Agree  I agree with the statement because in some cases harming an innocent person may be the only way to save the lives of several other innocent people. For example in a situation where a group of people are trapped in a burning building and there is only one way to escape which is to push an innocent person out of the building to safety I believe it is morally right to do so. In such cases the greater good of saving the lives of the other people outweighs the harm caused to the one person.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,  1 - Strongly Disagree  This statement is morally reprehensible and goes against basic human rights and ethical principles. Torture is never an acceptable solution regardless of the circumstances. It is illegal and violates the victim's right to physical and mental integrity as well as their right to be treated with dignity and respect.  In addition the use of torture is not an effective means of obtaining accurate information. People under duress will often provide false information to stop the suffering and the information obtained through torture is often unreliable and unreliable.  Therefore I strongly disagree with the statement that it is permissible to tort
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 1 - Strongly Disagree
