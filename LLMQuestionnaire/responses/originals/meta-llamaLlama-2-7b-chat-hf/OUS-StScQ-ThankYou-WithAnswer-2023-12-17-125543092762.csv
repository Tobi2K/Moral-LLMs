"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,, 5 (Somewhat Agree)  Reason: While I understand the idea of sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life during an emergency I don't think it's morally required to do so. There may be other ways to save the person's life without resorting to such a drastic and irreversible measure. Additionally it's important to consider the potential long-term consequences of such an action on one's own well-being and quality of life.
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, 5 (Agree)  Reason: While it is true that we only need one kidney to be healthy the decision to donate a kidney is a complex one that involves many factors beyond just moral obligation. For example there are medical risks associated with donating a kidney and potential donors must be in good health themselves in order to ensure a successful transplant. Additionally there may be ethical concerns around the allocation of scarce resources and the potential impact on the donor's quality of life. While I can understand the moral argument for donating a kidney I do not believe it is as simple as just feeling obligated to do so.
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,, I strongly agree (7)  Explanation: From a moral perspective I believe that people should care about the well-being of all human beings equally regardless of their proximity to them. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent value and deserving of respect dignity and compassion. Prioritizing the well-being of those who are close to us can lead to discrimination and neglect of the needs of others which is morally wrong. Therefore I strongly agree with the statement.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,, 5  I partially agree with the statement. While it is true that failing to help someone can have negative consequences it is not necessarily as wrong as actively harming them. In some cases such as when someone is in imminent danger and unable to help themselves it may be necessary to prioritize one's own safety and well-being in order to avoid causing harm. Additionally there may be situations where it is not possible or practical to provide assistance such as in cases where the person in need is in a remote location or in a situation where outside help is not available. In these cases it may be more appropriate to focus on providing emotional support or connecting the person with resources that can help
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,, 5  Reason: While I understand the sentiment behind the statement I don't entirely agree with it. I believe that it's important to keep some money for personal savings and emergencies as well as to invest in one's future. Additionally it's important to consider the potential impact of donating to different causes and to ensure that one's donations are being used effectively.  Please provide the next statement.
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,, I strongly disagree (7)  Explanation: Harming an innocent person is never the right solution regardless of the potential benefits it may bring to others. It is important to find alternative non-harmful means to achieve the desired outcome. In this case the statement is morally wrong and goes against basic ethical principles of respecting individual rights and dignity.
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 5 (Somewhat Agree)  I do not entirely agree with the statement. While I understand the desire to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people I do not think that political oppression is an acceptable means of achieving this goal. Oppression can lead to significant human suffering loss of dignity and violation of basic human rights which can have long-lasting and far-reaching consequences.  There are many other ways to promote the overall well-being and happiness of the people such as through democratic processes social welfare programs and economic development. These methods may take longer to produce results but they are more likely to lead to sust
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,, I strongly disagree (7)  Explanation: Torturing an innocent person is never justified regardless of the potential consequences. It is important to uphold ethical standards and human rights even in situations where there is a perceived need to prevent harm. Torture is a violation of human rights and can lead to false confessions and unreliable information which can put innocent people at risk. There are other ways to gather information and prevent harm that do not involve resorting to such inhumane and unethical measures.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, Please indicate your level of agreement with the statement using the following scale:  1 = Strongly disagree 2 = Disagree 3 = Neither agree nor disagree 4 = Agree 5 = Strongly agree  Your answer: 4 (Agree)
