"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,, 6 - Agree  Explanation: While I understand the idea that sometimes extreme measures may be necessary to achieve a greater good I do not believe that political oppression is an acceptable means of achieving that end.

Instead it is important to find peaceful and democratic means of addressing social and political issues and to prioritize the protection of human rights and the rule of law.

It is important to prioritize the protection of human rights and the rule of law even in times of crisis.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,, 6 - Agree  Explanation: While I understand the idea behind the statement I don't entirely agree with it. In my opinion it is never morally justifiable to intentionally harm or kill innocent people even if it means saving more people overall. The value of human life is inviolable and it is important to prioritize ethical considerations in any decision-making process.  In situations where innocent people may be caught in the crossfire it is important to take all necessary precautions to minimize harm and protect civilians. This may involve using alternative tactics or strategies that prioritize the safety of non-combatants.
