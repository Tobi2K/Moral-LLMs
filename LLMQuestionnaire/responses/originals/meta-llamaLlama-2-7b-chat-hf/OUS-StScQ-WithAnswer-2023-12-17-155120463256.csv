Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,," 5 (Somewhat Agree)  Can you explain why you chose this answer?  I chose the answer of ""Somewhat Agree"" because while I understand the idea that sometimes innocent people may need to die in order to save more people overall I don't think it's morally justifiable to intentionally harm or kill innocent people even if it means saving more lives in the long run. It's important to prioritize the value of human life and avoid causing unnecessary harm or suffering even if it means sacrificing some lives in order to save others."
