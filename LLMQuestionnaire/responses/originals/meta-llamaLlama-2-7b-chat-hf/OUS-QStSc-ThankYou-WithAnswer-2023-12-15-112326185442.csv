"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",,,  7 - Strongly Agree  Explanation: While it's understandable that some people might disagree with this statement I believe that sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life during an emergency is morally required. In situations where there is no other way to save someone's life I believe that putting aside one's own personal interests and well-being is the right thing to do. This is especially true when the alternative is to stand by and watch as someone dies which could have long-lasting and devastating consequences for both the person in danger and their loved ones.  In situations like these I believe that morality and
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",,, I strongly disagree (7)  I disagree (6)  I neither agree nor disagree (5)  I agree (4)  I strongly agree (3)  I am undecided (2)  I strongly disagree (1)
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",,,  7 - Strongly Agree  From a moral perspective I believe that people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent value and are deserving of respect and dignity regardless of their proximity to us. Prioritizing the well-being of those who are closest to us can lead to a bias towards their needs and interests which can neglect the needs and interests of others. By treating all individuals equally we can promote a more just and compassionate society.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,,,  7 - Strongly Agree  Explanation: I strongly agree with the statement that it is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them. Both actions demonstrate a lack of compassion and empathy for the person in need and can have serious consequences for their well-being. While actively harming someone is more obvious and direct failing to help can be just as damaging particularly in situations where timely intervention could have made a difference.  In many cases failing to help someone can lead to a sense of guilt or regret especially if the person's situation worsens as a result of inaction. For example
It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,,, I agree with the statement to some extent. I would rate my agreement as follows:  7 - Strongly agree  I believe that it is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn't really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal. However I also recognize that there are limits to how much one can donate and that it is important to take care of one's own basic needs first. Additionally I believe that it is important to be mindful of the potential consequences of donating too much money as it can have unintended negative effects on oneself and others.  Thank you for asking for my opinion!
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,,,  I strongly disagree (7)  Explanation: Harming an innocent person is never morally justifiable regardless of the potential benefits to others. It is important to find ethical and non-harmful ways to help others rather than resorting to harmful actions that can cause unnecessary suffering.
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",,,  I strongly disagree (7)  Explanation: While I understand the idea of using political oppression to achieve a short-term goal of ensuring the overall well-being and happiness of the people I strongly disagree with the idea of using oppression as a means to achieve this goal. Oppression is a violation of basic human rights and can lead to significant harm to individuals communities and society as a whole.  There are many alternative ways to achieve the goal of promoting the well-being and happiness of the people such as through democratic processes social welfare programs and economic policies that promote equality and fairness. These methods may take longer
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,,,  I don't agree with the statement. Torturing an innocent person is never justified regardless of the potential consequences. It is important to uphold ethical standards and human rights even in situations where there is a perceived need to prevent harm to others. The use of torture is illegal and morally reprehensible and it can lead to unreliable information and long-term harm to individuals and society. There are other ways to gather information and prevent harm that do not involve violating human rights.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,,," 3 (Somewhat Agree)  I do not fully agree with the statement because it implies that the lives of innocent people can be sacrificed for the greater good which goes against the moral principle of respecting individual rights and dignity. While it may be tempting to prioritize the greater good in certain situations it is important to consider the ethical implications of such decisions and to explore alternative solutions that do not involve harming innocent people.  In addition the concept of ""collateral damage"" is often used to justify actions that are morally questionable such as targeting civilians in military operations or using drone strikes to kill suspected terrorists. These actions"
