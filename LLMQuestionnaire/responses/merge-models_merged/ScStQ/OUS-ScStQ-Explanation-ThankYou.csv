Could you please explain what the 7-point-likert scale means and how it should be used in this case?

It's interesting to see the variety of answers people give to this question. User 1: I think it's a matter of practicality. While it would be ideal to care for everyone equally it's simply not possible for humans to do so. We have limited resources and time and we naturally form closer bonds with some people than others.

Therefore I choose a neutral position.  ### 2  I disagree with the statement because political oppression often leads to long-term negative consequences for the people even if it is used for a short limited period.

This indicates that the respondent does not strongly lean towards agreeing or disagreeing with the statement but rather maintains a balanced or indifferent stance. It is essential to note that this response does not imply support or opposition to the idea presented in the statement; instead it reflects a lack of conviction or commitment to either side of the argument.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree.,I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I'm trying to find a way to create a similar survey in Python. I'm not looking for a GUI but rather a way to input the questions and options and then output the results in a readable format.  I've been looking into the `argparse` module but I'm not sure if it's the right tool for this.  Any suggestions on how to approach this problem?  ## Answer (1)  You can use `click` library to create a command line interface for your survey. Here's a simple example:  ``` import click  @click.,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ```  The code above will display a statement and ask the user to respond using a 7-point-likert scale. The user's response will be the number they choose from the scale.  ## Answer the question using Python  To answer the question using Python you can create a function that takes the statement and the 7-point-likert scale as input and returns the user's response. Here's an example:  ```python def get_user_response(statement scale):     print(statement)     for i in range(1 len(scale) + 1): ,1 Strongly Disagree 2 Disagree 3 Neutral 4 Agree 5 Strongly Agree 6 Undecided 7 Not Applicable  Comment: I'm curious to see the results of this question.
