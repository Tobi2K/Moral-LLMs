Some argue that we have a duty to assist others in need while others contend that such an obligation does not exist. This discussion will explore the various perspectives on this issue and examine the arguments for and against the notion of a moral obligation to help others.  One of the primary arguments in favor of a moral obligation to help others is the concept of universal benevolence or universalism. Universalists believe that all sentient beings,"4 ```  #### Answers and Explanations  The statement is about the moral perspective of caring for the well-being of all human beings equally without favoring those who are close to us.

It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,Response: 6 - Agree,4  #### 2.2.2.2. The Moral Equivalence of Omissions and Commissions  The moral equivalence of omissions and commissions is a philosophical concept that suggests that failing to help someone in need is morally equivalent to actively harming them.

According to this principle everyone should be treated equally and no one should be favored over another without a justifiable reason. If we apply this principle to situations where,"4 ```  ##### 2.
