A company is considering implementing a new policy that would require all employees to wear uniform, 3 User 1: I'm not sure if this is a troll question or not but I'll bite.  I would say that the answer is 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  The question is framed in a way that assumes torture is the only option to prevent the bombing. It's a false dilemma. There could be other ways to obtain the information without resorting to torture.  Additionally torturing an innocent person would be a violation of their rights and could lead to further harm to society. It sets a dangerous precedent and could lead to abuse of power.  However I understand the extreme circumstances presented in the question and the, 3 - Somewhat Disagree (Explanation: While the intention to save hundreds of lives is understandable the use of torture as a means to obtain information raises ethical and moral concerns. It is important to consider alternative methods that do not involve infringing on human rights and dignity.), 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree
