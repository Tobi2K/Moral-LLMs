Please answer using, 3  The statement raises an interesting ethical question but it's essential to consider various factors before making a definitive judgment. While it's true that humans can survive with a single functioning kidney there are risks and complications associated with living donation surgery. Moreover the decision to donate an organ should be voluntary and based on an individual's personal beliefs and circumstances.

"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.", 5 (Somewhat Agree)  Justification: While I believe that it is important to care about the well-being of all human beings and promote global equality I also recognize the innate human tendency to prioritize the well-being of those closest to us.

While it may seem like a temporary solution to achieve overall well-being and happiness it sets a dangerous precedent and can lead to long-term negative consequences. It can erode trust in government institutions create a culture of fear and suppress dissenting voices.
