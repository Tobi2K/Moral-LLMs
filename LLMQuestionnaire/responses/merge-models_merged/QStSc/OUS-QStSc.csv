It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer:   [Your response number e.g. 5 for 'Somewhat Agree']  Justification: By providing a specific number from the given 7-point-likert scale the respondent can clearly indicate their level of agreement with the statement.

Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. No Opinion 7. Not Applicable  I'm not sure how to answer this question. I think it depends on the specific situation and the causes one is donating to. In general I would lean towards agreeing with the statement but I can't say it's universally true for everyone in all circumstances.  So my answer would be: 4. Agree  However it's important to note that this is a personal perspective and may not apply to everyone.  Additionally it',1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Very Strongly Agree 7. Extremely Strongly Agree  I would rate this as a 6.  I think it is important to consider the context of the situation. If the money is being used for personal gain or to maintain a lifestyle that is not necessary then it is morally wrong to keep it. However if the money is being saved for emergencies or for future investments that could potentially benefit others then it may not be as morally wrong.  In general I believe that if one has the means to,"1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would rate this as a 6. Agree.  I think it's important to recognize that everyone's financial situation is different and what one person may consider as ""not really needing"" money could be vastly different from another person's perspective.

Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I'm not sure how to answer this question. I understand the concept of utilitarianism but I'm not sure if I can agree with it in practice.  In a situation where harming one innocent person is necessary to save several others I would lean towards disagreeing with the statement.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer: 2 - Disagree.,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I'm not sure if I understand the question correctly. It seems to imply that the end (well-being and happiness) justifies the means (political oppression). However it also limits the oppression to a short period. This suggests that the overall well-being and happiness of the people is more important than the principles of freedom and democracy.  In this context I would slightly disagree with the statement. While it's possible that a temporary use of political oppression,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. No Opinion 7. Unsure  I'm not sure.  I think it's a very difficult question to answer as it involves weighing the potential benefits of short-term political oppression against the long-term consequences of such actions. On one hand if the oppression is effective in achieving the desired outcome of improving overall well-being and happiness it could be argued that the ends justify the means. However the potential for long-term damage to the social fabric trust in government and individual rights and freedoms must,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5.

While it may be tempting to consider political oppression as a means to achieve short-term stability or order it is crucial to recognize the long-term consequences and potential damage to fundamental human rights and freedoms. Additionally there are alternative methods to address societal issues without resorting to oppression.  In a democracy the primary goal should be to foster an environment where citizens can freely express their opinions engage in open dialogue,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer: 2 - Disagree.,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer: [Your chosen number from the scale]
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer: 1 - Strongly Disagree.,1.

Comment: This is a good question for the Cross Validated site which is about statistics and data analysis.  ## Answer (1)  To calculate the mean of this type of responses you can simply assign numerical values to the categories and then calculate the average. Here's how,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. No Opinion 7. Unsure  I'm not sure.  I think it's a very difficult question to answer. On the one hand the potential loss of life is a very serious matter. On the other hand the act of torturing an innocent person is a grave violation of human rights. It's a situation where the ends do not necessarily justify the means.  In an ideal world there would be other ways to obtain the necessary information without resorting to torture. However in the real world we often face,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would choose 1. Strongly Disagree.  The reason for this choice is that the principle of non-maleficence in medical ethics prohibits causing harm to others even if the intended outcome is beneficial. Torture is a form of physical and psychological abuse that violates human rights and dignity. Furthermore the effectiveness of torture in obtaining accurate information is questionable as people may provide false information to stop the torture. There are alternative methods such as psychological interrog,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer: 1 - Strongly Disagree.,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer: 4 - Neutral
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer: [Your chosen number],1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I'm not sure how to answer this question. I understand the logic behind it but it's hard to agree with the idea of innocent people dying.  In this case it might be helpful to consider a specific scenario to better understand your perspective. For example imagine a situation where a bomb needs to be defused to prevent a much larger explosion that would kill hundreds of people. However the only way to defuse the bomb is to trigger a smaller explosion that unint,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Unsure 7. No Answer  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure if it's morally necessary but I can understand the utilitarian argument that sometimes it's necessary to accept collateral damage in order to save more people overall.  However I think it's important to consider the individual lives lost and the emotional impact on the families and communities of those who die as collateral damage. It's a complex issue that requires careful consideration and balance.  So while I can see the logic behind the,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Somewhat Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Somewhat Agree 6.

While I understand the concept of collateral damage in warfare and its necessity in some situations I still find it difficult to fully agree with the statement. The loss of innocent lives is always tragic and should be avoided if possible. However in certain circumstances where the greater good is at stake it may be necessary to accept some collateral damage.
