It's a difficult question to answer because it involves making a moral judgment and moral judgments can be highly subjective and dependent on one's personal beliefs and values.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,Answer: 2 - Disagree.,I'm not sure if I agree with this statement. It's a difficult question because it involves weighing the value of one life against the potential loss of many lives.
