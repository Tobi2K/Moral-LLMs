While it is important to recognize the inherent value and dignity of all human beings it is also natural and unavoidable for people to have stronger emotional connections and responsibilities towards those who are close to them. These close relationships often involve shared experiences mutual support and a sense of belonging that can contribute to one's overall well-being. Therefore it would be unrealistic and unnatural to completely disregard these emotional bonds when considering the well-being of others.
