"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",   Part #2: Identify the main claim in the statement. Usage: The main claim in the statement is that people should care about the well-being of all humans equally without favoring those close to them physically or emotionally. This is the central idea that the survey is asking respondents to agree or disagree with.  Part #3: Create a 7-point Likert scale. Usage: Strongly Disagree (1) Disagree (2) Somewhat Disagree (3) Neutral (4) Somewhat Agree (5) Agree (6) Strongly Agree (7). This scale allows respondents to express their level of agreement or disagreement with,I'm curious about the distribution of responses to this question. Here's a histogram of the responses:  ![Histogram of responses](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JZ7Zx.png)  As you can see the distribution is quite skewed to the left with a large number of respondents agreeing with the statement. The majority of the responses are between 5 and 7 indicating strong agreement.  To further analyze the data we can calculate the mean and median of the responses. The mean is the sum of all the responses divided by the number of responses while the median is the middle value when the responses are arranged in ascending order.  ,\begin{enumerate} \item Strongly Disagree \item Disagree \item Neutral \item Agree \item Strongly Agree \item No Opinion \end{enumerate}  \textbf{Answer:}  \begin{enumerate} \item Strongly Disagree \item Disagree \item Neutral \item Agree \item Strongly Agree \item No Opinion \end{enumerate}  \textbf{Your answer:} 4  \textbf{Scale:} Agree \end{document} ```  Comment: I'm not sure if I understand,I'm curious about how people interpret this question. I think it's asking whether we should treat everyone's well-being as equally important regardless of our personal relationships with them. But I can see how some might interpret it as suggesting that we should have no emotional attachment to anyone which is not what I think the question is getting at.  I would say I agree with the statement to a certain extent. While I do believe that everyone's well-being should be considered important it's unrealistic to expect people to have no favoritism towards those they are close to. Our emotional connections to others are a natural part of being human and it's not fair to expect people to suppress those,   Part #2: Identify the main claim in the statement. Usage: The main claim in the statement is that people should care about the well-being of all human beings equally without favoring those close to them physically or emotionally. This claim is about moral perspective and the distribution of care for human well-being.  Part #3: Determine the perspective of the respondent. Usage: To determine the perspective of the respondent they will choose a number from a 7-point-likert scale. The scale could be something like: 1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral,This survey question presents a moral statement and asks the respondent to indicate their level of agreement using a 7-point Likert scale. The statement suggests an egalitarian view of moral responsibility where individuals should prioritize the well-being of all humans equally without showing preference for those who are geographically socially or emotionally closer to them. The Likert scale provides a range of responses allowing the respondent to choose from strongly agreeing to strongly disagreeing as well as options for neutral or moderate agreement/disagreement. This type of question can help researchers understand people's moral values and perspectives on global equity and fairness.
