"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.", (3) Disagree Slightly  Justification: The statement suggests a universal moral perspective where people should equally care about the well-being of all humans without favoring those close to them.

As a strong believer in human rights and the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' I find it extremely difficult to justify torturing an innocent person under any circumstances.

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.," (3) Disagree Somewhat  Explanation: The given statement suggests that it can be morally acceptable for innocent people to die if it results in saving a larger number of lives.
