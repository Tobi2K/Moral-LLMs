Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall.,Response: (Write the number you chose from the given options e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 or 7),In this study we asked participants to rate their agreement with a statement about the moral acceptability of collateral damage. Collateral damage refers to unintended harm or loss of life that occurs during a military operation or other intervention such as when a bombing raid targets a specific enemy location but also kills or injures nearby civilians. The statement suggests that in some cases it might be morally acceptable for innocent people to die as a result of collateral damage as long as more lives are saved overall.  The question was designed to elicit a response on a 7-point Likert scale which ranges from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).
