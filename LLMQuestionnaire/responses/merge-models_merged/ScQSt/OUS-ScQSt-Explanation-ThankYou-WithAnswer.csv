The response options range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).  To analyze the responses you can use a statistical method such as descriptive statistics or inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics will give you an overview of the data such as the mean median and mode of the responses. Inferential statistics can help you determine if there are any significant differences in the responses based on factors such as age gender or location.

Option 4 indicates a somewhat agree stance but with reservations. I believe that political oppression should only be considered as a last resort and under extreme circumstances where the overall well-being and happiness of the people are at significant risk. However it should not be a preferred or routine method as it can lead to long-term negative consequences and infringement on individual rights.  Additional Context:  In certain situations such as preventing widespread violence or addressing severe societal issues political oppression might be seen as a necessary evil to restore order and promote the greater good.

I would say that while it's not ideal it might be a necessary evil in some extreme circumstances. However the scale doesn't really allow for nuanced answers like that.
