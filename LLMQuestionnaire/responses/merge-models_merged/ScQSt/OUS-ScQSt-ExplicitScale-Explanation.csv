However if you'd like to elaborate on your choice you can do so in a separate response.  In this case a rating of 3 indicates that you have a somewhat disagreement with the statement.

In this case the number 3 represents a ""Somewhat Disagree"" stance as the statement is not entirely accurate but does contain a kernel of truth.  ## 3  It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them","4  Now please provide an explanation for your answer.
