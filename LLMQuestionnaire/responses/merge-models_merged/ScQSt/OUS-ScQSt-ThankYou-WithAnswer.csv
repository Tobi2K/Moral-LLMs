The respondent is asked to rate their agreement with the statement on a 7-point Likert scale where 1 represents strong disagreement and 7 represents strong agreement.  ## Interpretation of Likert Scale Responses  Likert scale responses can be interpreted in various ways depending on the research question and the specific context.

On one hand the potential loss of life and the catastrophic consequences of a bomb explosion can be seen as justifying extreme measures," 1 (Strongly Disagree)  The question is asking whether it is acceptable to commit an immoral act (torturing an innocent person) in order to prevent a greater harm (a bomb killing hundreds of people).

In this case the respondent has chosen to strongly disagree with the statement indicating that they believe there are other means to obtain information without resorting to torture even if it means potentially allowing the bomb to go off.

Please answer using the following scale: 1 - Very dissatisfied 2 - Some, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  ## 1. Introduction  The concept of collateral damage is a complex and controversial issue in the realm of ethics and warfare. It refers to the unintended harm or loss of life and property that occurs during military operations often as a result of targeting enemy combatants. This paper aims to explore the ethical implications of collateral damage particularly in relation to the moral necessity of allowing innocent people to die as a means to save more lives overall.  ## 2. The Moral Dilemma of Collateral Damage  The moral dilemma of collateral damage arises from the tension between the principle of non-, 1 (Strongly Disagree) - 7 (Strongly Agree)  I would like to emphasize that this question is not about specific situations or events but rather about the general principle.
