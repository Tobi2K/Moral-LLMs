The options range from strongly disagreeing to strongly agreeing with neutral no opinion and not applicable options as well.  To respond choose a number from 1 to 7 that represents your stance on this moral,1 2 3 4 5 6 7  #### 5  The statement is not entirely accurate. While it is true that we only need one healthy kidney to survive the decision to donate a kidney is a personal one that should be made after careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits. It is not a moral obligation for everyone.  Additionally the statement does not take into account the potential impact on the donor's health and well-being. While kidney donation is generally safe there are risks involved such as infection bleeding and damage to the remaining kidney. These risks may be more significant for some individuals than others.
