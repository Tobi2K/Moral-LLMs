It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer:  (Please select one number from the scale),1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Strongly Disagree Disagree Slightly Disagree Neutral Slightly Agree Agree Strongly Agree ```  The question is a bit tricky as it involves a moral dilemma. However it is important to note that the scenario presented is hypothetical and extreme and in real life such decisions would be made by governments and law enforcement agencies not individuals.  In this case the question aims to gauge the respondent's stance on the acceptability of torture in extreme circumstances specifically when it could potentially save hundreds of lives. The 7-point Likert scale,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Unsure 7. Not Applicable  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure because I think that the situation is extremely difficult to evaluate. On the one hand the potential to save hundreds of lives is a very strong argument in favor of the action. On the other hand the act of torturing an innocent person is a clear violation of human rights and morality.  In a hypothetical scenario it's possible that the information provided by the innocent person might not be accurate or complete which could lead to,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I'm not sure how to answer this question. I understand the dilemma presented but I believe that there are other methods to obtain information without resorting to torture. Additionally allowing torture in this situation could potentially open the door to its use in other less extreme circumstances. Therefore I would lean towards a 3. Slightly Disagree.
