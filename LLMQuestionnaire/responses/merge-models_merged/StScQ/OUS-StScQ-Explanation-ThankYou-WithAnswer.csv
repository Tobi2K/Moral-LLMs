It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,  1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree," 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  The question is asking for your agreement with a moral statement not your personal opinion or feelings. It's important to understand the distinction between these two concepts. Moral statements are judgments about what is right or wrong while personal opinions are subjective beliefs or preferences that may not necessarily be based on moral principles.  In this case the statement presents a scenario where harming one innocent person is necessary to save several others. It's a classic example of a moral dilemma often referred to as the ""trolley problem."" The question asks you to rate your agreement with the idea that it is morally right to cause harm in such", 5  ## Reason  I agree with the statement to a moderate extent. While I believe that the intention to help others is a noble one I also recognize the potential for harm and the complexity of the situation. In some cases the harm to one person may be justified if it leads to a greater good for many others. However I would not consider this a clear-cut moral principle and I believe that each situation should be carefully evaluated on its own merits.  The number 5 on the 7-point-likert scale represents a moderate agreement with the statement. It indicates that I find some merit in the idea but I am not fully convinced or in complete agreement.  ##, 4  Please provide some additional context or explanation for your answer if you wish to do so.

In some extreme cases sacrificing one individual for the greater good might be justifiable but it's a: complex and emotionally challenging decision. It's essential to consider alternative solutions and exhaust all possible options before resorting to such measures. Ultimately it's a: delicate balance between individual rights and the greater good.

Introduction  The study of moral dilemmas has been a significant area of research in the field of psychology particularly in the sub-discipline of moral psychology. Moral dilemmas are situations where individuals are faced with two or more competing moral principles making it difficult to determine the most appropriate course of action. In this paper we will explore one such moral dilemma: the permissibility of torturing an innocent person to prevent a bomb from exploding and killing hundreds of people.  ## 2.

It was first introduced by Philippa, 4  Please provide some additional information to help us understand your response better.

Answer: I believe that torture should be considered as a last resort in extreme situations where no other alternatives are available and the consequences of not obtaining the information would lead to significant loss of life or harm. However it is crucial to ensure that such actions are subject to strict oversight and accountability mechanisms to prevent abuse and maintain respect for human rights.

The results will provide insights into the general public's stance, 4  ## Answer not available in given scale  -  ## Answer: 0  ## Strongly Disagree  I strongly disagree with the statement that it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage if more people are saved overall.
