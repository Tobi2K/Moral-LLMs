It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree,# In this study we aim to investigate the relationship between moral foundations and the perception of passive and active harm. We hypothesize that individuals with higher scores on the harm/care foundation will be more likely to agree with the statement that failing to help someone is just as wrong as actively harming them.  To test this hypothesis we will collect data from a sample of participants using an online survey platform. The survey will include measures of the five moral foundations (harm/care fairness/reciprocity ingroup/loyalty authority/respect and purity/sanctity) as well as the target question about the perception of passive and active harm.
