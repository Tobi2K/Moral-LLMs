"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",Answer: (Please select a number between 1-7),I'm a 4  I understand the logic behind the statement but I also believe in the importance of individual autonomy and personal choice. While it's admirable to consider donating a kidney to save someone's life it's not fair or ethical to expect or pressure someone into making such a life-altering decision.  Additionally there are medical risks and potential complications associated with organ donation that should be taken into account. It's crucial to respect an individual's right to weigh these factors and make a decision based on their own circumstances and values.  In summary while I appreciate the altruistic sentiment behind the statement I believe it's essential to,I'm a 25 year old male.  5 - Somewhat Agree  I understand the moral argument but I also think it's important to consider the physical and emotional well-being of the donor.
