Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Unsure 7. Not applicable  The question is asking whether or not you believe that in an emergency situation where the only way to save someone else's life is to lose your own leg you are morally obligated to make that sacrifice.

No Answer  I'm not sure.  I think it depends on the situation and the person. For some saving a life is the most important thing and they would be willing to make that sacrifice. For others their own well-being and quality of life is more important and they might not be willing to make that sacrifice. It's a very personal decision.  In general I would say that if the person making the decision is someone who values the sanctity of life and is not in a life-,1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Slightly Disagree 4. Neutral 5. Slightly Agree 6. Agree 7. Strongly Agree  I would answer with a 6. Agree.  The reason for this answer is that in situations where saving another person's life is at stake and there are no other alternatives making a self-sacrifice for the greater good is generally considered a noble and morally responsible act. This is especially true when the sacrifice involves saving someone else from imminent danger or death.

"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.","1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer:   [Your response number e.g. 5 for ""Somewhat Agree""]  Justification: By providing a response on the given 7-point Likert scale the user can indicate their level of agreement with the statement.

I don't know  I'm not sure if I completely agree with the statement. While it is true that we only need one kidney to be healthy there are still risks and complications associated with donating a kidney.

Strongly Agree  I would choose 6. Agree  The statement raises an interesting moral dilemma. From a biological perspective it is true that humans can survive with just one functioning kidney. However the decision to donate an organ should not solely be based on what we can physically endure but also on our personal beliefs values and circumstances.  While some may argue that altruistic organ donation can save lives and improve the quality of life for others it is essential to,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer:   [Your response number],1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree  Answer:   Justification: This question presents a statement that discusses the ethical aspect of donating a kidney to someone in need.

I think that it's important to care for the well-being of all human beings but it's also natural and unavoidable to have stronger emotional connections with some people than with others. These connections can lead to a greater sense of responsibility and care towards those individuals. However this doesn't mean that we should disregard the well-being of others.

While it is ideal to care for everyone equally it is natural for humans to have stronger emotional connections with those who are close to them.

On one hand it's tragic that innocent people have to die in order to save others. On the other hand if the overall outcome is that more lives are saved it's hard to argue against that.

I think it's a very difficult question to answer in the abstract because it depends on the specific circumstances. In some cases it might be true that allowing some innocent people to die is the lesser evil compared to the alternative. But it's aerably tragic and should never be taken lightly.
