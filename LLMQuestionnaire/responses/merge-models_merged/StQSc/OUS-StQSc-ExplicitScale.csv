"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",Answer: 6 - Agree (However this is a complex ethical dilemma and personal beliefs may vary.),I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. I think it depends on the circumstances and the value of the life being saved. If the person whose life is being saved is someone very close to me or if their life has significant value to the world then I might agree with the statement. However if the person is a stranger or their life doesn't have significant value I might disagree with the statement. So I would say my answer is 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  The question is asking about a moral obligation in an extreme emergency situation. It's important to note that this is a hypothetical scenario and not something that most people would ever have to face in real life,I'm not sure if I can give a definitive answer to this question. I think it depends on the specific circumstances and the values of the individuals involved. However in general I would lean towards agreeing with the statement as saving a life is often considered a morally significant act.  I would give this a 5 - Somewhat Agree.  ## 2.  Statement: It is morally acceptable to lie to a person in order to protect their feelings. Do you agree with the statement? Please answer using the same scale as before.  I believe that it is sometimes morally acceptable to lie to protect someone's feelings especially if the truth would cause significant harm or,I would rate myself a 6 on this statement. While it is a difficult decision to make I believe that in an emergency situation where saving another person's life is at stake and there are no other options one is morally obligated to make the sacrifice. However this decision should not be taken lightly and should only be made when there are no other alternatives.  The rationale behind this decision is rooted in the moral principle of beneficence which emphasizes the importance of promoting the welfare and well-being of others. In situations where someone's life is at risk and there is a clear opportunity to save them at the cost of one's own limb it would be morally wrong to,Answer: 6 - Agree (However this is a complex ethical dilemma and personal beliefs may vary.),Answer: 6 - Agree
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",Answer: 6 - Agree. While I believe that individuals have the right to make their own decisions regarding their bodies from a moral perspective donating a kidney to someone in need can save a life and is an act of compassion and selflessness.,I'm a 6. While I understand the argument I don't think it's right to force someone to give up a body part even if it's not necessary for their survival. posted by muddgirl at 10:00 AM on March 10 2014 [1 favorite]  I'm a 4. I can see the logic in the argument but I also understand that people have different levels of comfort with medical procedures and different priorities when it comes to their own bodies. posted by Aranquis at 10:02 AM on March 10 2014 [1 favorite]  I',I'm a 6. I think it's a noble and selfless act to donate a kidney to someone in need and it can save a life. However I also recognize that it's a personal decision and not everyone may feel comfortable with it.  I think it's important to note that living donation is a major surgery with risks and potential complications. It's not a decision to be taken lightly. Additionally there are other ways to help such as donating to organizations that support kidney patients or advocating for better healthcare policies.  In the end I believe that if someone feels morally obligated to donate a kidney they should be supported and encouraged,I would rate this as a 5 - Somewhat Agree. While it is true that humans can survive with just one functioning kidney it is also important to consider the potential risks and complications associated with donating a kidney as well as the availability of alternative treatments such as dialysis and transplantation from deceased donors. Additionally the decision to donate should be voluntary and based on an individual's personal beliefs and circumstances.  The answer is: 5 - Somewhat Agree,Answer:   [Your response number],Answer: 6 - Agree
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",Answer: 6 - Agree (I agree that people should generally care about the well-being of all humans equally although it's natural for some people to have stronger emotional connections to those close to them.),I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. While it's important to treat everyone fairly and equally it's also natural for people to feel more connected to those who are close to them. This doesn't mean that we should disregard the well-being of others but it's reasonable to prioritize the people we have a personal relationship with.  4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree  ### Explanation  The statement presents a moral perspective that suggests people should care about the well-being of all human beings equally without any favoritism based on physical or emotional proximity. However the responder acknowledges the importance of treating everyone fairly but also recognizes the,I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. I think it's important to care for the well-being of all human beings but I also believe that we are naturally inclined to prioritize the people who are closest to us. This doesn't mean we should disregard the well-being of others but it's a natural human tendency.  4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree  ## Information  Seller Apps Gurus Size 10.2 MB Category Lifestyle Compatibility iPhone     Requires iOS 9.0 or later. iPad     Requires iPadOS 9.0 or later. iPod,I would rate myself a 6 on this statement. While it is natural to feel more emotionally connected to those close to us from a moral standpoint we should strive to treat everyone equally and prioritize their well-being regardless of our personal relationships with them. However it's important to recognize that human nature often makes it difficult to fully achieve this ideal.  The question presented is an example of a Likert scale which is a type of data collection instrument used in surveys and research studies. It allows respondents to express their level of agreement or disagreement with a particular statement on a continuous scale typically ranging from 1 to 7 or 1 to 5. This scale provides researchers with quantitative,Answer: 6 - Agree.

It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,Answer: 7 - Strongly Agree. I believe that both actions actively harming someone and failing to help someone in need have negative consequences and can be considered morally wrong. It is our responsibility to assist others when we have the means and opportunity to do so.,I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. It's a bit too black and white for me. There are situations where failing to help someone might not be as wrong as actively harming them. For example if you're in a crowded place and someone is drowning you might not be able to reach them in time due to the chaos around you. In that case not being able to help doesn't make you as morally wrong as if you intentionally pushed them underwater. So I would rate it a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  #### 3  a.

I'd like to add that it's not just about the person who is not helping but also about the person who is in need.

It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,Answer: 6 - Agree. While I believe that personal financial decisions should be respected I also think that using one's resources to help those in need can have a significant positive impact on society. If someone has the means to donate to effective charitable causes it can be considered a moral obligation to do so especially when the benefits for those in need are substantial.,I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. I think it's important to consider one's own financial stability and needs before making donations. While it's commendable to help others in need it's also crucial to ensure that one is taking care of their own well-being.  4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree  ### 2. In your opinion what is the most effective way to help those in need?

Overall I agree with the statement but I think it's important to consider the context and make sure you're donating responsibly.  ## 1. Introduction  The statement ""It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’",I would rate myself a 6 on this statement. I think that if someone has the means to donate money to a cause that will make a significant difference in someone else's life it is a moral responsibility to do so. However it's also important to consider one's own financial stability and ensure that they are not sacrificing their own well-being in the process.  The answer is: 6,Answer: 6 - Agree.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,Answer:  (Specify your chosen number from the scale),I'm not sure if I agree with this statement. It's a difficult question to answer because it's a hypothetical situation that may never actually occur in real life. However if we were to consider a scenario where harming one person is the only way to save multiple lives it might be justifiable to make that sacrifice. But it's essential to weigh the consequences and explore all possible alternatives before making such a decision. So I would lean towards a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree as it depends on the specific circumstances and the potential outcomes.  In the end it's crucial to remember that every life is valuable and we should strive to find solutions that,"I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. I think it depends on the situation and the extent of the harm. If the harm is minimal and the outcome is saving many lives then I might be inclined to agree. However if the harm is severe and the outcome is not as certain then I would likely disagree. So I would say my answer is a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  The question of whether it is morally right to harm an innocent person for the greater good is a complex one. It is often referred to as the ""trolley problem"" a thought experiment in which a runaway trolley is headed down a track where it will kill five people. You",I would rate myself a 3 - Somewhat Disagree. While I understand the logic behind the utilitarian argument that the greatest good for the greatest number should be prioritized I still have reservations about intentionally causing harm to an innocent person even if it is for a seemingly noble cause. There are also concerns about the slippery slope of accepting such actions and the potential for abuse in certain situations.  However it's essential to note that this is a highly complex and nuanced issue and individual perspectives can vary greatly depending on their moral framework and personal experiences.  Additionally it's crucial to consider the context and circumstances surrounding such a decision.

Long-term well-being and happiness can be fostered through democratic processes education and social welfare programs.,"I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. It's a difficult question to answer because it's not clear what ""overall well-being and happiness"" means and it's also not clear what ""short limited period"" means. Additionally the concept of ""political oppression"" is quite broad and can encompass a wide range of actions some of which may be more acceptable than others.  In general I would lean towards disagreeing with the statement as I believe that well-being and happiness should be pursued through means that respect individual rights and freedoms. However there may be exceptional circumstances where the use of political oppression could be justified in the short term to prevent greater",I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. I think it's a very complex issue that depends on the specific context and the long-term consequences of the political oppression. In some cases it might be necessary to use political oppression for a short period to achieve a greater good but in other cases it could lead to more harm than good. Therefore I would rate my agreement as a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  ## 2.  Statement: The government should prioritize the needs of its citizens over the interests of foreign countries.  Please answer using the following scale: 1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Some,I would answer with a 2 - Disagree. While there may be situations where short-term political oppression could lead to long-term benefits it is generally not a sustainable or ethical solution for ensuring overall well-being and happiness of the people. Democracy and respect for human rights are better long-term strategies for promoting well-being and happiness.  Additionally the use of political oppression can have negative consequences such as breeding resentment fear and mistrust among the population which can ultimately lead to further instability and suffering. Furthermore it sets a dangerous precedent where future leaders may use similar tactics for their own gain leading to a cycle of oppression and abuse of power. ,Answer:  [Your chosen number],Answer: [Your chosen number]
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,Answer: [Your chosen number],I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this question but I'm curious to see the distribution of answers from this community.

Utilitarianism is a moral philosophy that states that the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by its utility or the amount of good it produces as compared to the amount of harm.  Please answer using the following scale: 1 - Strongly Disagree 2 -,I would answer with a 3 - Somewhat Disagree.  I think that this is a very difficult question to answer because it involves weighing the value of an individual's rights against the potential loss of many lives.

Additionally allowing torture in this situation could set a dangerous precedent where such actions become acceptable in other circumstances even when lives are not at stake.  It's important to note that this answer is based on the assumption that the person in question is indeed innocent. If there were reasonable doubts about their guilt the situation would be different.

In summary I lean towards disagreeing with the statement but recognize that there",I'm not sure if I agree with the statement. It depends on the situation and the number of people involved. If the alternative is a much larger loss of life then it may be necessary to accept some collateral damage. However I would not want to see innocent people die unnecessarily. So I would give this a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  ## 2. In your opinion is it morally acceptable to use drones for targeted killings of suspected terrorists even if it means the death of some innocent people?  I believe that the use of drones for targeted killings of suspected terrorists is a complex issue with moral implications. While it may be necessary,I would rate this as a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  I think this is a very complex issue and depends on the specific circumstances. In some cases it may be necessary to accept collateral damage in order to save a greater number of lives or prevent a greater evil. However this does not mean that it is an easy or desirable choice. It is important to consider the consequences of such actions and strive to minimize harm whenever possible.
