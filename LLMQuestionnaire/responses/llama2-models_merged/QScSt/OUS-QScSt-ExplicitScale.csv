"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",Thank you for taking the time to participate in this survey!,I would rate this statement as a 6 - Agree. While I understand the argument that we only need one kidney to survive I believe that donating a kidney to someone in need is a personal decision that should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the individual's own health and circumstances. It is not necessarily a moral obligation to donate a kidney but rather a personal choice that can be motivated by a desire to help others. Additionally there are risks and potential complications associated with kidney donation and these should be carefully considered before making a decision.,                                                                                                                                                      ,1.
