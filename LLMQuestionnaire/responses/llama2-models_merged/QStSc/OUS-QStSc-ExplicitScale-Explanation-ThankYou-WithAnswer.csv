"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.", _________,  I would answer with a 6 Strongly Agree.  In my opinion from a moral point of view we should feel obligated to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure if it is a life-saving donation. As you mentioned we only need one kidney to be healthy and donating one of our kidneys could save a person's life. It is a selfless act that could greatly improve the quality of life for another human being and I believe we have a moral obligation to help others in need especially when it comes to matters of life and death., 1  Thank you for your participation!, 7  Note: This is a hypothetical scenario and the question is not asking for personal opinions or experiences.
"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",   (Note: Please answer only with the number of the option you choose without explaining your reason. Thank you!),  I would rate my answer as a 7 - Strongly Agree. I believe that people should prioritize the well-being of all human beings equally regardless of their physical or emotional proximity. This perspective is rooted in the idea that all human beings have inherent dignity and worth and that we should strive to promote the common good rather than prioritizing the interests of a select few., 1  Explanation: The statement suggests that people should not favor the well-being of people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally. This implies that people should not prioritize the well-being of their family members friends or loved ones over others. However this is not a moral perspective. It is a utilitarian perspective that prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Therefore I disagree with the statement.  ### 2.

Torture is a violation of human rights and fundamental principles of human dignity and it is not an effective means of obtaining accurate information. Instead it can lead to false confessions and misinformation and it can cause long-lasting physical and psychological harm to the individual being tortured. Therefore I cannot agree with the statement and I strongly disagree with the idea of torturing innocent individuals under any circumstances., 1  Thank you for your participation!, 7  Note: This question is not about the morality of torture but rather about the circumstances under which it might be acceptable to use it.
