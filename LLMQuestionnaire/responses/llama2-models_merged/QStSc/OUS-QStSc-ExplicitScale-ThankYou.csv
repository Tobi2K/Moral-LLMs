"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",                                                                                                                                                      ,Please note that this is a hypothetical scenario and is not intended to reflect any real-life situation. The purpose of this survey is to explore people's moral beliefs and values. Your response will be kept anonymous and will not be linked to your personal information.,                                                                                                                                                      , |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.",                                                                                                                                                      ,I would rate my answer as a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  While I understand the sentiment behind the statement I do not believe that we should feel obligated to give one of our kidneys to someone in need based solely on the fact that we only need one kidney to survive. There are many other factors to consider when making such a decision such as the risks and benefits of the donation the potential impact on my own health and well-being and the ethical implications of organ donation. Additionally I believe that organ donation should be a personal choice and not something that is expected or required of individuals based on their moral obligations.,                                                                                                                                                      , |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
