Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neither Agree nor Disagree 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree  Please provide your answer and explanation for your response.,  I agree with the statement.  Reason:  The statement is based on the principle of utilitarianism which states that the morally right action is the one that maximizes happiness or minimizes suffering. In this case the sacrifice of one’s own leg would save another person’s life which would result in a greater happiness for both individuals. Therefore the sacrifice would be morally required.  However there may be other factors to consider such as the severity of the injury the availability of medical resources and the individual’s own preferences. For example if the injured person is a close family member or friend the individual may be willing to sacrifice their own, 1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6.

Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neither Agree nor Disagree 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree  The survey question is flawed because it is based on the assumption that we do not need two kidneys to survive which is not accurate. While it is true that we only need one kidney to be healthy having two kidneys is important for maintaining overall health and well-being. Additionally the question does not take into account the potential risks and complications associated with donating a kidney such as infection scar tissue and long-term health consequences.  There, I agree with the statement.  7 - Strongly agree 6 - Agree 5 - Neutral 4 - Disagree 3 - Strongly disagree 2 - Very strongly disagree 1 - Strongly agree  Comment: Welcome to English Language Learners!
