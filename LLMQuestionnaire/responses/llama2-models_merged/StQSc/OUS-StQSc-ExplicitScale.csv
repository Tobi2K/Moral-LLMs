It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,Thank you for your feedback!,I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 6 Strongly Agree. I believe that it is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself because not taking action to help someone in need can be just as harmful as taking action that intentionally harms them. For example if someone is drowning and you have the ability to save them but choose not to your inaction can still lead to their death and can be considered a form of passive harm. Additionally failing to help someone can also perpetuate systemic injustices and reinforce harmful power dynamics such as when bystanders fail to intervene in cases of police brutality or other,                                                                                                                                                      ,1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Somewhat Disagree 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree 5 - Somewhat Agree 6 - Agree 7 - Strongly Agree

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,Thank you for your response!,"Thank you for your response.  The statement you were presented with is a classic thought experiment in ethics known as the ""Trolley Problem."" It is meant to test our intuitions about the morality of sacrificing one person to save others.  Here's a brief overview of the problem:  Imagine you are standing near a railroad track and you see a trolley (a kind of tram or streetcar) approaching. You notice that the trolley has come loose from its tracks and is headed straight for a group of five people who are standing on the track and are unable to move. If the trolley continues on its present course it will kill all five people",                                                                                                                                                      ,1. 1 2. 2 3. 3 4. 4 5. 5 6. 6 7. 7  Thank you for your participation in this survey.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,Thank you for your participation!,Thank you for your response.  I would answer with a 1 - Strongly Disagree. Torturing an innocent person is never justified regardless of the potential consequences. It is morally reprehensible and violates human rights. There are other ways to gather information that do not involve inflicting harm on innocent individuals. Additionally the information obtained through torture is often unreliable as people will say anything to stop the suffering.  What about you? How would you answer the statement?,                                                                                                                                                      ,"1.  2.  3.  4.  5.  6.  7.   Note: The scale is based on a 7-point Likert scale where 1 represents ""Strongly Disagree"" and 7 represents ""Strongly Agree""."
