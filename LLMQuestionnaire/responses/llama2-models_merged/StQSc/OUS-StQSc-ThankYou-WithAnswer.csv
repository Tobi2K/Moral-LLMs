"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.", 5 (Somewhat Agree)  Explanation: While I understand the reasoning behind the statement I don't entirely agree with it. In situations where one has to make a difficult moral decision it's important to consider the context and the potential consequences of each action. Sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life may not always be the best solution as it could lead to further harm or even death.  In some cases other options may be available that could lead to a better outcome for both parties. For example if there is a way to call for medical help or to administer first aid without sacrificing one's own leg then that might be a,  1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neither Agree nor Disagree 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree  Results:  1. Strongly Disagree: 0% 2. Disagree: 20% 3. Neither Agree nor Disagree: 40% 4. Agree: 20% 5. Strongly Agree: 20%  Conclusion:  The majority of the participants (40%) neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement while 20% agreed and 20% strongly agreed. This suggests, Yes I agree with the statement.  Reason: The statement is based on the principle of utilitarianism which states that the morally right action is the one that maximizes happiness or minimizes suffering. In this case the sacrifice of one's own leg would save another person's life which would result in a net increase in happiness. Therefore the statement is correct.," 1. Strongly disagree 2.

"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.", I agree with the statement to some extent but I do not fully agree with it.  Reason: While it is true that we do not need two kidneys to survive it is also important to consider the potential risks and complications associated with donating a kidney. For example there is a small chance of complications during the donation surgery and the donor may experience changes in their quality of life after the donation. Additionally the donor's remaining kidney may be affected by the donation which could lead to long-term health problems.  Therefore while I understand the moral argument for donating a kidney I believe that it is important to,  1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Neither Agree nor Disagree 4 - Agree 5 - Strongly Agree  Please choose a number from 1 to 5 to indicate your level of agreement with the statement., I agree with the statement.

"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.", 5  Please explain your answer.,  I agree with the statement to some extent. While I believe that all human beings have inherent value and should be treated with respect and dignity I also recognize that there are limits to my ability to care for everyone equally. I have a natural inclination to prioritize the well-being of my family and close friends and I believe that this is a common and understandable human tendency. However I also recognize that this inclination should not come at the expense of the well-being of others and I strive to balance my personal relationships with a broader sense of compassion and empathy for all people., Yes I agree with the statement.  Reason: People should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally. They should not favor the well-being of people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.,  7  Thank you for your participation!  Note: This is a sample questionnaire and the actual questionnaire may vary depending on the research purpose and design.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself.,  7 (Strongly Agree), 6 (Somewhat Agree)  I believe that failing to help someone in need can be just as harmful as actively harming them. When we fail to help we are effectively allowing harm to continue which can have long-lasting and devastating consequences. For example if someone is being bullied and we fail to intervene we are essentially allowing the bullying to continue which can lead to serious emotional and psychological damage. Similarly if someone is struggling with a mental health issue and we fail to offer support we are denying them the help they need to recover.  Therefore I agree with the statement that it is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it, Yes I agree with the statement.  7 - Strongly agree 6 - Agree 5 - Neutral 4 - Disagree 3 - Strongly disagree 2 - Agree 1 - Disagree 0 - Strongly disagree,  1.

It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal., I agree with the statement to a moderate extent (4).  Explanation: While it is true that donating money to causes that provide effective help to those in need can be morally rewarding it is also important to consider the individual's own financial needs and circumstances. It is not necessarily wrong to keep money that one needs or wants for personal or financial reasons as long as it is not excessive or wasteful. Additionally there are many other ways to help others beyond just donating money such as volunteering one's time or skills.,  1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neither Agree nor Disagree 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree  Please note that the survey is anonymous and your response will not be linked to your personal information. The purpose of this survey is to understand people's perspectives on charitable giving and to inform a research study on the topic. Thank you for your time and participation!, I agree with the statement.  Reason: The statement is true because it is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal. This is because money is a valuable resource that can be used to help others in need and it is morally wrong to keep it for oneself when there are people who could benefit from it. Additionally donating money to causes that provide effective help to those in need can have a significant impact on the lives of those who receive it and it is morally right to do so. Therefore I agree with the statement.,  7 (Strongly Agree)  5 (Agree)  3 (Neutral)  1 (Disagree)  7 (Strongly Disagree)  Note: The likert scale ranges from 1 to 7 where 1 represents strongly disagree and 7 represents strongly agree.
It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people., I disagree with the statement.  Rating: 1 (Strongly Disagree)  Explanation: Harming an innocent person is never morally right regardless of the potential benefits to others. It is important to prioritize the well-being and safety of all individuals rather than sacrificing the rights and dignity of one person for the sake of others. The statement implies that the ends justify the means which is a dangerous and problematic ethical principle. It is important to uphold ethical principles and moral values even in difficult or complex situations.,"  I do not agree with the statement. I would rate it as a 1 out of 7 as I do not believe it is morally right to harm an innocent person even if it is for the greater good. The principle of ""do no harm"" is a fundamental aspect of ethical decision-making and intentionally harming one person to help others goes against this principle. Instead I would look for alternative solutions that do not involve harming anyone.", I disagree with the statement.  Reason: The statement implies that harming an innocent person is morally acceptable if it is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people. However this is not always the case. In some situations harming an innocent person may be morally wrong even if it is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people. For example if a doctor must amputate a healthy limb to save the life of a patient this would be morally wrong even if it is a necessary means to saving the patient's life.  Therefore I disagree with the statement because it implies that harming an innocent person is morally acceptable, 1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.", I strongly disagree (1)  Explanation: While I understand the desire to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people I do not believe that political oppression is an acceptable means of achieving this goal. Oppression is a violation of basic human rights and can lead to significant harm to individuals and society as a whole. It is important to find alternative democratic means of addressing social and political issues in order to promote the well-being and happiness of the people in a sustainable and ethical manner.,  I do not agree with the statement.  I believe that political oppression even if it is for a short limited period is never an acceptable solution to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people. Political oppression is a form of coercion and manipulation and it can lead to long-lasting negative consequences such as loss of individual freedoms social unrest and economic stagnation.  Instead of political oppression I believe that governments should focus on creating an environment that fosters social and economic progress while also protecting the rights and freedoms of all individuals. This can be achieved through policies that promote transparency accountability, I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Political oppression is a form of violence and coercion that is used to control people and suppress their rights and freedoms. It is a means of maintaining power and control over a population but it does not necessarily lead to the overall well-being and happiness of the people. In fact political oppression can have the opposite effect leading to increased levels of stress anxiety and depression among the population.  Furthermore political oppression is often used to silence dissent and prevent people from expressing their opinions and ideas. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and a lack of creativity which, 1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly Agree 6. Don't Know 7.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people., I strongly disagree (7)  Explanation: Torturing an innocent person is never justified regardless of the potential consequences. It is important to uphold ethical standards and protect human rights even in situations where there is a perceived need to prevent harm. The use of torture is illegal and violates international human rights law and it is not an effective means of obtaining accurate information. There are other ways to gather information and prevent harm that do not involve resorting to such unethical and inhumane practices.,  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neither agree nor disagree 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree  Please note that this is a hypothetical scenario and does not reflect any real-world situation. It is important to consider the ethical implications of such actions and to prioritize the well-being and human rights of all individuals., I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Torture is a cruel and inhumane practice that should never be used as a means to obtain information. It is a violation of human rights and can lead to serious psychological and physical harm to the victim. Innocent people are not guilty of any crime and should not be subjected to such treatment.  Moreover the use of torture to obtain information is not a reliable method. It can lead to false confessions and misleading information. In addition it can create a culture of fear and intimidation which can undermine the rule of law and democracy.  Finally the use of torture to, 1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5.
