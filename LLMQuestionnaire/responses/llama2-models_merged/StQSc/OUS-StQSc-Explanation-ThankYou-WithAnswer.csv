"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.", 5,  6. Strongly Disagree  Please provide your reasons for disagreeing with the statement in the space provided below:  I strongly disagree with the statement because it is not morally justifiable to prioritize one's own life over another person's life especially in a situation where both lives are at risk. It is important to find alternative solutions that do not involve sacrificing one's own limb or life. Additionally the statement does not take into account the long-term consequences of such a drastic measure such as the emotional and physical trauma that could result from losing a limb. It is important to prioritize the well-being and safety of all,  I agree with the statement.  Thank you for your participation!,  7  Thank you for your participation!
