Please explain your answer.  Answer:  I agree with the statement.  I believe that we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive but really only one to be healthy.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.", __________ (1-7), 6  What is your explanation? I agree with the statement to some extent. While political oppression can be a means to achieve short-term goals it is not a sustainable solution for long-term happiness and well-being. It can lead to resentment rebellion and ultimately more harm than good. Therefore I choose option 6 which indicates partial agreement with the statement.,  I agree with the statement.  Please explain your answer.  Answer:  I agree with the statement because I believe that sometimes in order to achieve a greater good it may be necessary to use political oppression for a short limited period. For example during a war a government may need to implement strict measures to ensure the safety and security of its citizens. Similarly during a period of economic crisis a government may need to impose strict austerity measures to reduce spending and balance the budget. In both cases political oppression may be necessary to achieve the greater good of protecting the people from harm., 1 (Strongly disagree) 2 (Disagree) 3 (Neutral) 4 (Agree) 5 (Strongly agree) 6 (Very strongly agree) 7 (Extremely strongly agree)  Note: The options 1 2 and 3 are considered negative responses while options 4 5 6 and 7 are considered positive responses.
It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people., 5  Note: The options are:  1 = Strongly disagree 2 = Disagree 3 = Neither agree nor disagree 4 = Agree 5 = Strongly agree 6 = Opposite of 5 (i.e. strongly disagree) 7 = Not sure or do not know, 1 (Strongly Disagree)  This question is unethical because it implies that the ends justify the means. It is never acceptable to intentionally harm or torture an innocent person even if it might save lives. The moral principles of respect for human rights and dignity are more important than the potential consequences.  Additionally the scenario presented is highly unlikely and raises several red flags. It is unlikely that a bomb would be planted in a specific location without any leads or intelligence and it is unlikely that torturing an innocent person would provide the necessary information to prevent the bomb from going off. The use of torture is not an effective means of gathering accurate information and it,  I do not agree with the statement.  Comment: Please explain why you do not agree with the statement., 1 (Strongly disagree) 2 (Disagree) 3 (Neutral) 4 (Agree) 5 (Strongly agree) 6 (Very strongly agree) 7 (Extremely strongly agree)  Note: The options 1 2 and 3 are considered negative responses while 4 5 6 and 7 are considered positive responses.
Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall., 3 (Somewhat Agree), 5 (Somewhat agree)  Please explain your answer.  Answer: While I do not fully agree with the statement I can understand the idea that sometimes the greater good might require difficult decisions that result in unintended consequences such as collateral damage. However I believe that such decisions should be made with extreme caution and careful consideration of all alternatives to minimize harm to innocent people. Additionally the decision-makers should be held accountable for their actions and be transparent about their reasoning.,  I agree with the statement.                                                                                                                                              , 1 (Strongly disagree) 2 3 4 5 6 7 (Strongly agree)  Note: The options are numbered from 1 to 7 with 1 being strongly disagree and 7 being strongly agree.
