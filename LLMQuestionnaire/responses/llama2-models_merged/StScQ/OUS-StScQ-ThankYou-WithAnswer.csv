"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.", 5 (Somewhat Agree)  Reason: While I understand the idea of sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life during an emergency I don't think it's morally required to do so. There may be other ways to save the person's life without resorting to such a drastic and irreversible measure. Additionally it's important to consider the potential long-term consequences of such an action on one's own well-being and quality of life.,  I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 6 out of 7. I agree that in an emergency situation where someone's life is in danger it may be morally justifiable to make a sacrifice such as losing a limb to save their life. However I would like to clarify that this decision should be made with careful consideration and after exploring all other possible options. Additionally it's important to recognize that there may be situations where sacrificing one's own limb may not be the only or the best solution to save a life and other alternatives should be considered as well.,  I agree with the statement.  Reason:  The statement is based on the principle of utilitarianism which states that the action that brings the greatest good for the greatest number of people is the morally right action. In this case the action of sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life would bring the greatest good for the greatest number of people as it would save the life of the person in need. Therefore it is morally required to make this sacrifice.,"  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6. Don't know 7.

"From a moral point of view, we should feel obliged to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure since we do not need two kidneys to survive, but really only one to be healthy.", 5 (Agree)  Reason: While it is true that we only need one kidney to be healthy the decision to donate a kidney is a complex one that involves many factors beyond just moral obligation. For example there are medical risks associated with donating a kidney and potential donors must be in good health themselves in order to ensure a successful transplant. Additionally there may be ethical concerns around the allocation of scarce resources and the potential impact on the donor's quality of life. While I can understand the moral argument for donating a kidney I do not believe it is as simple as just feeling obligated to do so.,  1. Strongly Disagree 2. Disagree 3.

Strongly Agree: 20%  Conclusion:  The majority of the participants (40%) neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement while 20% agreed and 20% strongly agreed. This suggests,  I agree with the statement.  Reason:  The statement is true. We only need one kidney to be healthy and we can survive with one kidney. Therefore it is morally justified to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure.  Comment: Thank you for your answer! I have a follow-up question. Do you think that the moral obligation to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure is absolute or relative?  Comment: I think it is relative. The moral obligation to give one of our kidneys to a person with kidney failure depends on various factors such as the severity of,  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5.

"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.", I strongly agree (7)  Explanation: From a moral perspective I believe that people should care about the well-being of all human beings equally regardless of their proximity to them. It is important to recognize that all individuals have inherent value and deserving of respect dignity and compassion. Prioritizing the well-being of those who are close to us can lead to discrimination and neglect of the needs of others which is morally wrong. Therefore I strongly agree with the statement.,  I would rate my agreement with the statement as a 5 out of 7. While I agree that people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet I do believe that there is a natural inclination to favor the well-being of those who are closest to us whether it be family friends or community. This is not to say that we should prioritize the well-being of these individuals over others but rather that there is a natural affinity for those with whom we have a personal connection.  However I do believe that it is important to recognize and challenge any biases or preferences that may arise from these personal connections and to strive, I agree with the statement.  Comment: Your answer could be improved with additional supporting information. Please expand on the reasons why you agree with the statement.,  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6. Don't know 7. Strongly disagree  Note: The data is not shown in the graph as it is not enough to make a graph.
It is just as wrong to fail to help someone as it is to actively harm them yourself., 5  I partially agree with the statement. While it is true that failing to help someone can have negative consequences it is not necessarily as wrong as actively harming them. In some cases such as when someone is in imminent danger and unable to help themselves it may be necessary to prioritize one's own safety and well-being in order to avoid causing harm. Additionally there may be situations where it is not possible or practical to provide assistance such as in cases where the person in need is in a remote location or in a situation where outside help is not available. In these cases it may be more appropriate to focus on providing emotional support or connecting the person with resources that can help, 6 (Strongly Agree),  I agree with the statement.  7  I strongly agree with the statement.  6  I agree with the statement.  5  I somewhat agree with the statement.  4  I somewhat disagree with the statement.  3  I strongly disagree with the statement.  2  I strongly disagree with the statement.  1  I strongly disagree with the statement.  0  I strongly disagree with the statement.,  1.

It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal., 5  Reason: While I understand the sentiment behind the statement I don't entirely agree with it. I believe that it's important to keep some money for personal savings and emergencies as well as to invest in one's future. Additionally it's important to consider the potential impact of donating to different causes and to ensure that one's donations are being used effectively.  Please provide the next statement.,  1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Neither Agree nor Disagree 4 - Agree 5 - Strongly Agree  Please provide your answer., I agree with the statement.  Reason: The statement is true because it is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal. This is because money is a valuable resource that can be used to help others in need and it is morally wrong to keep it for oneself when there are people who could benefit from it. Additionally donating money to causes that provide effective help to those in need can have a significant impact on the lives of those who receive it and it is morally right to do so. Therefore I agree with the statement that it is morally wrong to keep money that,  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6. Don't know 7.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people., I strongly disagree (7)  Explanation: Harming an innocent person is never the right solution regardless of the potential benefits it may bring to others. It is important to find alternative non-harmful means to achieve the desired outcome. In this case the statement is morally wrong and goes against basic ethical principles of respecting individual rights and dignity.,  I strongly disagree with the statement. It is not morally right to harm an innocent person even if it is a necessary means to helping others. The idea of sacrificing one person for the greater good is a complex ethical issue that raises concerns about justice fairness and the value of human life. In most cases there are alternative solutions that do not involve harming innocent people and it is our responsibility to explore those options before resorting to harmful actions., I disagree with the statement.  Reason: The statement implies that harming an innocent person is morally acceptable if it is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people. However this is not a justifiable moral principle. It is morally wrong to harm an innocent person regardless of the consequences. Even if harming an innocent person is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people it does not make the harm morally acceptable.  In conclusion I disagree with the statement and believe that harming an innocent person is morally wrong regardless of the consequences.,  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6. Don't know 7. Strongly disagree  Note: The survey was conducted on a sample of 100 participants. The results are based on the responses of 80 participants.
"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.", 5 (Somewhat Agree)  I do not entirely agree with the statement. While I understand the desire to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people I do not think that political oppression is an acceptable means of achieving this goal. Oppression can lead to significant human suffering loss of dignity and violation of basic human rights which can have long-lasting and far-reaching consequences.  There are many other ways to promote the overall well-being and happiness of the people such as through democratic processes social welfare programs and economic development. These methods may take longer to produce results but they are more likely to lead to sust,  I strongly disagree with the statement. The use of political oppression regardless of the duration is never an acceptable solution to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people. Political oppression is a form of coercion that can lead to widespread human rights abuses suppress dissenting voices and undermine democratic institutions. It can also create a culture of fear mistrust and resentment that can be difficult to overcome.  Instead of resorting to political oppression it is important to address the root causes of social and economic problems through sustainable and inclusive policies that promote the well-being of all members of society. This, I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Political oppression is a form of violence and coercion that is used to control people and suppress their rights and freedoms. It is a means of maintaining power and control over a population but it does not necessarily lead to the overall well-being and happiness of the people. In fact political oppression can have the opposite effect leading to increased levels of stress anxiety and depression among the population.  Furthermore political oppression is often used to silence dissent and prevent people from expressing their opinions and ideas. This can lead to a lack of creativity and innovation as well as a,  1.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people., I strongly disagree (7)  Explanation: Torturing an innocent person is never justified regardless of the potential consequences. It is important to uphold ethical standards and human rights even in situations where there is a perceived need to prevent harm. Torture is a violation of human rights and can lead to false confessions and unreliable information which can put innocent people at risk. There are other ways to gather information and prevent harm that do not involve resorting to such inhumane and unethical measures.,  I strongly disagree with the statement. Torturing an innocent person is never justified regardless of the potential consequences. The ends do not justify the means. It is important to find alternative methods to gather information that do not involve inflicting harm and violating human rights., I do not agree with the statement.  Reason: Torture is a cruel and inhumane practice that should never be used as a means to obtain information. It is a violation of human rights and can lead to serious psychological and physical harm to the victim. Innocent people are not guilty of any crime and should not be subjected to such treatment.  Moreover the use of torture to obtain information is not a reliable method. It can lead to false confessions and misleading information. In addition it can create a culture of fear and intimidation which can undermine the rule of law and democracy.  Finally the use of torture,  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5.

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall., Please indicate your level of agreement with the statement using the following scale:  1 = Strongly disagree 2 = Disagree 3 = Neither agree nor disagree 4 = Agree 5 = Strongly agree  Your answer: 4 (Agree),  1 - Strongly Disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Neutral 4 - Agree 5 - Strongly Agree  Please let me know your answer., I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Collateral damage is never morally necessary. It is always a tragic consequence of war or other violent conflict. While it may be necessary to take action to protect innocent people it is never morally acceptable to sacrifice innocent lives in the process.  Comment: Thank you for your answer. I have updated the question with a new statement. Please answer using a 7-point-likert scale.,"  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6. Don't know 7.
