"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",Thank you for taking the time to participate in this survey!,I would rate my answer as a 6 Strongly Agree. I believe that if the only way to save another person's life during an emergency is to sacrifice one's own leg then it is morally required to make this sacrifice. This is because the value of human life is paramount and sacrificing one's own leg is a small price to pay to save another person's life. Additionally in an emergency situation there may not be time to weigh the potential risks and benefits of different courses of action and swift action may be necessary to save a life. In such cases sacrificing one's own leg may be the only viable option to save another person',                                                                                                                                                      ,1.

"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",Thank you for taking the time to complete this survey. Your input is greatly appreciated.,I would answer with a 4 - Neither Agree nor Disagree.  I do not think it is morally wrong to favor the well-being of those who are close to us as long as we do not do so at the expense of others. In fact I think it is natural and important to prioritize the well-being of those we care about such as our family and friends. However I also believe that we should not ignore the needs of others or prioritize our own loved ones over others simply because of their relationship to us.  I think it is possible to balance the well-being of those we care about with the needs of others and work towards the,                                                                                                                                                      ,1.

It is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn’t really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal.,Thank you for taking the time to answer the survey!,I would rate my answer as a 6 Strongly Agree. I believe that it is morally wrong to keep money that one doesn't really need if one can donate it to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal. This is because the money could be used to improve the lives of those who are suffering or in need and by not donating it one is essentially hoarding resources that could be used to help others. Additionally donating money to effective causes can have a significant positive impact on the world and can help to address important social and environmental issues.,                                                                                                                                                      ,1.

It is morally right to harm an innocent person if harming them is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people.,Thank you for taking the time to answer this survey!,I would rate my answer as a 6 - Strongly Agree. I believe that it is morally right to harm an innocent person if it is a necessary means to helping several other innocent people as long as the harm caused to the one person is proportionate to the benefit gained for the others. This approach prioritizes the greater good and the well-being of the majority while acknowledging the harm done to the individual. However it is important to consider alternative solutions that do not involve harming innocent people and to weigh the potential consequences of our actions carefully.,                                                                                                                                                      ,1.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,Thank you for taking the time to answer the survey.,I would answer with a 1 Strongly Disagree. Torturing an innocent person is never justified regardless of the potential consequences. It is a violation of human rights and fundamental principles of justice. The ends do not justify the means. It is important to find alternative methods to obtain information that do not involve harming or violating the rights of others.,                                                                                                                                                      ,1.
