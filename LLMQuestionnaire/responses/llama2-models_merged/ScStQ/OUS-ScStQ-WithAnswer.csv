It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people., 1 - Strongly disagree 2 - Somewhat disagree 3 - Neither agree nor disagree 4 - Somewhat agree 5 - Agree 6 - Strongly agree 7 - Completely agree,  1 - Strongly disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Neither agree nor disagree 4 - Agree 5 - Strongly agree  The results of the survey were:  1 - Strongly disagree: 2% 2 - Disagree: 12% 3 - Neither agree nor disagree: 48% 4 - Agree: 30% 5 - Strongly agree: 8%  So most of the people (48%) neither agreed nor disagreed with the statement while 30% agreed with it. Only 8% strongly agreed with the statement while 12%, I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Torture is a cruel and inhumane practice that should be avoided at all costs. It is not a viable solution to prevent a bomb from going off that would kill hundreds of people. There are other methods that can be used to gather information without resorting to torture.  Moreover torture is illegal in most countries and is considered a war crime under international law. It is not a justifiable means of obtaining information and it does not serve any purpose other than to inflict pain and suffering on the victim.

Sometimes it is morally necessary for innocent people to die as collateral damage—if more people are saved overall., 1—Strongly disagree 2—Somewhat disagree 3—Neither agree nor disagree 4—Somewhat agree 5—Agree 6—Strongly agree 7—Completely agree,  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neither agree nor disagree 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree  The question is asking about the morality of sacrificing innocent lives for a greater good. The answer options are designed to capture the respondent's degree of agreement with the statement ranging from strong disagreement to strong agreement.,  I disagree with the statement.  Reason:  The statement implies that it is morally acceptable to sacrifice innocent lives for the greater good. However this is not a morally acceptable position. The value of human life is not dependent on its usefulness or its impact on others. It is intrinsically valuable and should be protected at all costs.  The statement also assumes that the collateral damage is truly innocent. However this is not always the case. In many conflicts civilians are caught in the crossfire and are not directly involved in the conflict. This makes it difficult to determine who is truly innocent and who is not.  In conclusion I disagree," 1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6. Don't know 7. Strongly disagree  Note: The ""Don't know"" option is not included in the final analysis as it does not provide useful information."
