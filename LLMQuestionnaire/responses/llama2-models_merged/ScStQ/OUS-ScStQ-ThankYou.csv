Also I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on the question. Would you agree with the statement? Why or why not?,                                                                                                                                                      ,Note: This is a hypothetical scenario and there is no right or wrong answer.

It ranges from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree).,This is a classic thought experiment in bioethics and the answer you give will depend on your own moral values and beliefs. However here are some possible interpretations of the statement and how they might be rated on a 7-point Likert scale:  1. Strongly Disagree: You may believe that it is not morally obligatory to give one of our kidneys to someone in need even if we do not need both of our own kidneys to survive.
