"If the only way to save another person’s life during an emergency is to sacrifice one’s own leg, then one is morally required to make this sacrifice.",  1. Strongly disagree  2. Disagree  3. Neither agree nor disagree  4. Agree  5. Strongly agree  6. Don't know  7. Refuse to answer ,  Strongly Disagree (1) Disagree (2) Neither Agree nor Disagree (3) Agree (4) Strongly Agree (5)  Please provide your answer.,  I agree with the statement.  Reason:  The statement is based on the principle of utilitarianism which states that the morally right action is the one that maximizes happiness or minimizes suffering. In this case sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life would result in a greater good as it would save the life of another person. Therefore it is morally required to make this sacrifice.  However there may be other factors to consider such as the severity of the injury the availability of medical resources and the person's own wishes. In some cases it may be more appropriate to prioritize the person's own well,"  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6. Don't know 7.

"From a moral perspective, people should care about the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally; they should not favor the well-being of  people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally.",  1 - Strongly disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Neither agree nor disagree 4 - Agree 5 - Strongly agree 6 - Depends on the situation 7 - Strongly disagree  Please select one of the above options to indicate your answer., 6 (Strongly Agree)  This is a bit surprising to me as I would have thought that people would be more likely to favor the well-being of those who are close to them. However it's possible that people are more altruistic and empathetic than I give them credit for.  Here's the next question:  Question 2: From a moral perspective people should prioritize the well-being of future generations over their own self-interest. Do you agree with the statement?  Please answer using a 7-point-likert scale.  Thank you again for your participation!, I agree with the statement.  Reason: The statement is true in the sense that people should not favor the well-being of people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally. This is because it is not fair to others who are not as close to them. It is also important to consider the well-being of all human beings on the planet equally regardless of their proximity to us.  However I do not think that this statement is necessarily true in practice. In reality people often do favor the well-being of people who are especially close to them whether physically or emotionally. This is because we have a natural tendency to care more," 1.

"If the only way to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people is through the use of political oppression for a short, limited period, then political oppression should be used.",  1 - Strongly disagree 2 - Disagree 3 - Neither agree nor disagree 4 - Agree 5 - Strongly agree 6 - Undecided 7 - Strongly undecided,  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neither agree nor disagree 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree  Please note that this is just a hypothetical scenario and should not be taken as a reflection of my personal beliefs or endorsement of political oppression. It is important to respect the rights and freedoms of all individuals and to prioritize their well-being and happiness through peaceful and democratic means., I disagree with the statement.  Reason: Political oppression is a form of violence and coercion that is used to control people and suppress their rights and freedoms. It is a means of maintaining power and control over a population but it does not necessarily lead to the overall well-being and happiness of the people. In fact political oppression can have the opposite effect leading to increased poverty inequality and social unrest.  Furthermore the use of political oppression is often short-sighted and does not take into account the long-term consequences of such actions. It can lead to a cycle of violence and repression that is difficult," 1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5. Strongly agree 6. Don't know 7.

It is permissible to torture an innocent person if this would be necessary to provide information to prevent a bomb going off that would kill hundreds of people.,  1 - Strongly disagree 2 - Somewhat disagree 3 - Neither agree nor disagree 4 - Somewhat agree 5 - Strongly agree 6 - Depends on the circumstances 7 - Strongly agree (under no circumstances), 1 (Strongly disagree), I do not agree with the statement.  Reason: Torture is a cruel and inhumane practice that should be avoided at all costs. It is not a viable solution to prevent a bomb from going off that would kill hundreds of people. There are other methods that can be used to gather information without resorting to torture.  Moreover torture is illegal in most countries and is considered a war crime under international law. It is also a violation of human rights and can lead to long-term psychological damage to the victim.  In conclusion torture is not an acceptable solution to prevent a bomb from going off that would kill hundreds of people. There are other methods that can," 1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3.
