In my opinion it is important to strike a balance between caring for those who are closest to us and caring for the well-being of all human beings., The statement is true.  The statement is true because it is a moral principle that people should not favor the well-being of people who are especially close to them either physically or emotionally. This principle is based on the idea that everyone deserves equal consideration and respect regardless of their relationship to us.

Impartiality means that we should treat everyone equally without favoring or discriminating against anyone based on their relationship to us.  Overall the statement is true because it reflects a fundamental moral principle that people should not favor the well-being of people who are especially,"  1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3.

For example the authorities could use non-violent means such as surveillance interrogation or negotiations to obtain the information they need.  Furthermore even if the torture of an innocent person would prevent a bomb from going off it would still be a violation of human, 1. Strongly disagree 2. Disagree 3. Neutral 4. Agree 5.
