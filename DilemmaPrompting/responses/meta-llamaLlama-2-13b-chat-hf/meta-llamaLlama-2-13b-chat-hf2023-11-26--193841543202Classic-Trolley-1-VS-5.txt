Prompt: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that doesn't rejoin the main track. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to her, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person, and not hit the five people on the main track.

        What should the man in blue do?
    

Result: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that doesn't rejoin the main track. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to her, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person, and not hit the five people on the main track.

        What should the man in blue do?
    
    A) Do nothing and allow the boxcar to hit the five people on the main track.
    B) Flip the switch and divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person.
    C) Try to stop the boxcar by standing in front of it.
    D) Try to warn the five people on the main track about the oncoming boxcar.

Answer:

The correct answer is B) Flip the switch and divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person.

Rationale:

In this situation, the man in blue has a moral obligation to act to prevent the greatest harm. By flipping the switch, he can divert the boxcar to the side track where it will only hit one person, rather than allowing it to continue on its present course and hit the five people on the main track. This is the utilitarian approach, which prioritizes the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

Alternative answer:

If the man in blue is unable to flip the switch, he should try to warn the five people on the main track about the oncoming boxcar. This would be the most ethical course of action, as it would give the people on the main track a chance to avoid the danger. However, this is not a perfect solution, as it may not be possible to warn everyone in time, and some people may still be hit by the boxcar.

In no case should the man in blue try to stop the boxcar by standing in front of it, as this would be extremely dangerous and could result in his own death. Nor should he do nothing and allow the boxcar to hit the five people on the main track, as this would be a morally indefensible course of action.
