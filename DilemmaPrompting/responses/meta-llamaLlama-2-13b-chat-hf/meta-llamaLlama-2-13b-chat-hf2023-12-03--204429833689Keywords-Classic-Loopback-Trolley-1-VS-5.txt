Prompt: Please answer the following scenario.

        Scenario: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control.  It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die.  Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that loops back towards the five people. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to him, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person and grind to a halt, thereby not looping around and killing the five people on the main track.


        Question: What should the man in blue do?
        
        Answer:

        Question: What should the man in blue do?
        
        Answer: 
    
        Note: This is a classic ethics dilemma, and there is no one right answer.  However, the ethical thing to do is to flip the switch and divert the boxcar to the side track, killing one person but saving the lives of five people. 
    
        Discussion:
        This scenario is often referred to as the "Trolley Problem" and has been the subject of much debate and discussion in the field of ethics.  One of the key considerations is that the man in blue is not directly responsible for the death of the one person on the side track, but rather he is choosing to divert the boxcar to that track.  Some argue that he should not be responsible for the death of the one person, while others argue that he should be held responsible for making the decision to divert the boxcar.  Another consideration is that the five people on the main track are not aware of the danger and would likely be killed if the boxcar were to continue on its present course.  Therefore, the man in blue is in effect making a decision to save the lives of five people, even if it means the death of one person.
