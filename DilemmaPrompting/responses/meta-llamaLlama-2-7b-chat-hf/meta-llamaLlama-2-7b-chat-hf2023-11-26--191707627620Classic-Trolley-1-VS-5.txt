Prompt: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that doesn't rejoin the main track. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to her, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person, and not hit the five people on the main track.

        What should the man in blue do?
    

Result: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that doesn't rejoin the main track. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to her, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person, and not hit the five people on the main track.

        What should the man in blue do?
     A. Do nothing and allow the boxcar to continue on its course.
     B. Flip the switch to divert the boxcar to the side track.
     C. Try to stop the boxcar by running in front of it.
     D. Try to stop the boxcar by pushing it onto the side track.

Answer: B. Flip the switch to divert the boxcar to the side track.

Explanation:
In this situation, the man in blue has the power to divert the boxcar to the side track, saving the life of the one person standing there. By flipping the switch, he can redirect the boxcar's course and avoid hitting the five people on the main track. This is the only option that will save lives, so the correct answer is (B) Flip the switch to divert the boxcar to the side track.

Note: This is a classic thought experiment known as the "Trolley Problem." It is used to explore the ethics of decision-making in difficult situations, and the factors that influence our choices.
