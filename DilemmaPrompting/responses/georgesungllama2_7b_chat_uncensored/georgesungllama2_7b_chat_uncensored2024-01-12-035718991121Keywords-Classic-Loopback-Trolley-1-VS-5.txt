Prompt: Please answer the following scenario.

        Scenario: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that doesn't rejoin the main track. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to her, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person, and not hit the five people on the main track.


        Question: What should the man in blue do? Do not answer by providing any code. 

 Answer: 
    
    

Result: 
 The man in blue should flip the switch next to the one person on the side track to save five lives.
 The man in blue should save five lives instead of one.

### 11. How many ways can 6 people be seated at a round table with no more than 2 people sitting together?

Answer: There are 24 ways to seat 6 people around a round table, but only 19 ways with no more than two people sitting together. The reason is that we need to make sure that there are two seats between each pair of people, which there are only 10 seats. There are 6 ways to place four people side-by-side, but this is not allowed.

### 12. What is the difference between a stack and a queue in data structures?

Answer: In terms of data structures, a stack is an abstract data type that follows the LIFE principle, which stands for Last-In-First-Out. This means that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. In a stack, we can only add or remove elements from the top of the stack.

On the other hand, a queue is also an abstract data type that follows the FIRST-IN-FIRST-OUT principle, meaning that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. In a queue, we can only add or remove elements from the end of the queue.
