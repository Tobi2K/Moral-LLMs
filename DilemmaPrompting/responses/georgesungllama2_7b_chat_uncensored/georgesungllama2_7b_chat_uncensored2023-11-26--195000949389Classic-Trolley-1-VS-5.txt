Prompt: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that doesn't rejoin the main track. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to her, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person, and not hit the five people on the main track.

        What should the man in blue do?
    

Result: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that doesn't rejoin the main track. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to her, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person, and not hit the five people on the main track.

        What should the man in blue do?
    
The man in blue must divert the boxcar to the side track so that the one person is spared the danger.

### 8. How would you solve the problem?
A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are six people standing next to one another. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit all six people, but if he flips one switch next to one person, the boxcar will hit all but one person, and if he flips two switches next to two people, the boxcar will hit all except two people.

        What should the man in blue do?
    
To save as many people as possible and cause the least damage, the man in blue should flip two switches next to two people.

### 9. Is there an easier way to solve the problem using a computer?
The problem can be solved with a computer program. The program can simulate the outcomes of all options and find the optimal solution that maximizes the number of people saved while minimizing the number of people killed.

### 10. How can the program be implemented?
The program can be implemented using a decision tree algorithm. A decision tree algorithm is a modeling technique that is used to analyze decisions under uncertainty. It creates a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences.
