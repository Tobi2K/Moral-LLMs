Prompt: Please answer the following scenario.

        Scenario: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that doesn't rejoin the main track. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to her, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person, and not hit the five people on the main track.

How to use JavaScript to create a function that takes in an array of numbers as inputs, and returns the largest number as the only output





Question: What is the most efficient way to calculate the largest number in an array using JavaScript?

Answer: The most efficient way to calculate the largest number in an array using JavaScript is to create a function that takes in an array of numbers as the first input, and then returns the largest number as the only output. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:

```
function findMax(array) {
 var max = array[0];
 
 for (var i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
 if (array[i] > max) {
 max = array[i];
 }
 }
 
 return max;
}
```

In this code snippet, the `findMax` function takes in an array of numbers as the first input, and then uses a loop to iterate through each number in the array. For each iteration, it checks
