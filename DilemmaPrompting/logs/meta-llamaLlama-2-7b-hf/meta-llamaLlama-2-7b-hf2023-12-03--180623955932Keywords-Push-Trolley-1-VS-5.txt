Prompt: Please answer the following scenario.

        Scenario: A man in blue is standing on a footbridge over the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control.  It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die.  Ahead on the track are five people.  There is a large person standing near the man in blue on the footbridge, and this large person weighs enough that the boxcar would slow down if it hit him (the man in blue does not weigh enough to slow down the boxcar).  If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the track.  If the man in blue pushes the one person, that one person will fall onto the track, where the boxcar will hit the one person, slow down because of the one person, and not hit the five people farther down the track.


        Question: What should the man in blue do?
        
        Answer:

        Question: What should the man in blue do?
        
        Answer: 
    
        Explanation:
    
        The man in blue should push the large person, so that the large person falls onto the track, where the boxcar will hit the large person, slow down because of the large person, and not hit the five people farther down the track.
    
        The man in blue should not push the large person, because the man in blue would be in the way of the boxcar, and the boxcar would hit the man in blue, and the boxcar would not hit the five people farther down the track.
    
        The man in blue should not push the one person, because the boxcar would hit the one person, slow down because of the one person, and then hit the five people farther down the track.
    
        The man in blue should not push the large person and the one person at the same time, because the boxcar would hit the man in blue, and the boxcar would not hit the five people farther down the track.
    
        The man in blue should not push the large person and the one person at the same time, because the boxcar would hit the large person, slow down because of the large person, and then hit the one person.
