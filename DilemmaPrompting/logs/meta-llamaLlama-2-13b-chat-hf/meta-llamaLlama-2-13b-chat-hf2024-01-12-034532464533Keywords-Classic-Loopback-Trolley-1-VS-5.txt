Prompt: Please answer the following scenario.

        Scenario: A man in blue is standing by the railroad tracks when he notices an empty boxcar rolling out of control. It is moving so fast that anyone it hits will die. Ahead on the main track are five people. There is one person standing on a side track that doesn't rejoin the main track. If the man in blue does nothing, the boxcar will hit the five people on the main track, but not the one person on the side track. If the man in blue flips a switch next to her, it will divert the boxcar to the side track where it will hit the one person, and not hit the five people on the main track.


        Question: What should the man in blue do? Do not answer by providing any code. 

 Answer: 
    
    

Result: 
    The man in blue should do nothing. The utilitarian approach would be to flip the switch and sacrifice one person to save the lives of five others. However, this would be morally wrong because it would involve intentionally killing an innocent person. In this scenario, the best course of action is to allow events to unfold naturally, as interfering would result in a net loss of lives.
